Introduction: explaining the whaling cycle
Global whale catch statistics have been collected since the late 1860s. In the 20th Century, the data show a
sustained increase in global catch until the start of the 1960s after which catches decline markedly and stocks
appear to stabilise. Analysis of the data reveals a whaling cycle very much as would be expected for an openaccess marine resource that is initially abundant but which then gets successively overexploited, species by
species. The resulting scarcity motivated international efforts to regulate the catch and those regulations
determine the current whale stock at an albeit much reduced level compared to a century ago. But how far were
international regulations the driving force in stabilising whale populations? In this paper we argue that economic
forces leading to reduced catches were at work long before international regulations came into being. To a
considerable extent, therefore, harvests would have stabilised anyway. As others have shown with respect to
various international environmental agreements (e.g. Barrett, 1994), co-operative international regulation often
formalises a non-co-operative outcome, i.e. the outcome that would have occurred in the absence of the
regulation. As such, agreements may be self-enforcing. Such a conclusion should not detract from co-operative
regulatory efforts, but it does suggest that those efforts are less effective than some political and legal analysts
might argue.
We identify two basic economic forces at work. First, as predicted in bio-economic theory (e.g. Clark, 1973,
1990), declining stocks raise the unit costs of harvest, making whaling ultimately less attractive from a
commercial standpoint. Offsetting this effect is technological change in the whaling industry that lowered costs
for long periods, explaining why the demise of the whaling population takes a substantial period to materialise.
Second, whaling products have substitutes and as these substitutes became more plentiful, so the commercial
incentive to catch whales declined. In order to isolate the various forces at work, we produce a straightforward
econometric analysis of whale catch time series and the economic factors determining catches.
The historical record of whale catches
We begin by constructing an historical series of whale catch. With the regular publication of International
Whaling Statistics by the Committee for Whaling Statistics in Oslo, Norway as a requirement under Article IV of
the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, whale catch data was recorded as far back as 1868,
and in more detail since 1909-10. With total Antarctic whaling making up between 60% and 80% of whaling
world-wide through the course of time1, catch data conform to the Antarctic season. The Southern Hemisphere
season lasted from December until March, while the Northern Hemisphere season followed in the summer
thereafter. Hence – unless catch is specified to be Antarctic only – Antarctic seasons indicated as e.g. 1909-10
include the summer season for 1910 in the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific. By extracting the data from the published
volumes of the Committee for Whaling Statistics since 1931, it was possible to plot numbers of whales caught
world-wide by species and by country since the onset of pelagic whaling2.

The International Whaling Statistics allow us to identify numbers of whales caught in the Antarctic – total and pelagic – by species, which
in comparison to catch data world-wide enables a percentage calculation of the Antarctic stake.

Although a wide range of whale species has been caught throughout the phase of modern whaling, the main
target species consisted of the Blue, Fin, Humpback, Minke, Sei and Sperm whale. Floating factories and
catchers were not specialised in the kind of species they caught, but instead were easily transferable between
individuals or nations and flexible in the processing of baleen whale species. Whalers aimed for the biggest
individuals available, thereby maintaining the industry by successively targeting new species. Being the biggest,
and therefore initially the most profitable, the Blue whale was the first species to be depleted below its maximum
sustainable yield, with a peak of 29,650 animals being killed in the 1930-31 season. After World War II, during
which whaling temporarily ceased altogether, population levels declined steadily until the Blue whale was given
full protection world-wide in 1966.
The second biggest species, worth half a Blue in terms of oil production3, was the Fin whale, and its path of
depletion displays a similar pattern to that of the Blue whale, albeit slightly shifted to the right. The Fin catch
peaked before the second World War at around 30,000, but continued to be harvested at 20,000 -30,000 whales
per annum until the mid 1960s.
The Humpback whale, the Sei whale, the Sperm whale and the Minke whale follow similar patterns of peak and
decline. The Humpback whale was roughly similar to the Fin whale in terms of oil value, but depleted at much
lower absolute numbers due to less abundant population levels. Reaching its pre-war peak a year before the Fin
at 9,863, it followed a similar pattern to the Fin harvest with a steady catch of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in postwar years until the 1962-63 season marked the decline. Worth only a sixth of a Blue, the Sei whale was spared
until the early 1960s, when catch reached its single peak at 25,453 individuals declining rapidly thereafter with a
mere 634 being harvested in 1977-78. Although not part of the BWU, sperm whale oil as a means of lighting
lamps and producing candles experienced a boom between 1820 and 1850, but vanished rapidly due to its
replacement by kerosene. In the late 1950s, however, the US government launched its space rocket programme,
buying sperm whale oil as a specialised lubricant, thereby raising its price fivefold and making the chase for this
species highly valuable. With the Soviet Union also starting to concentrate upon sperm whales for their oil use in
specialised machinery, this, the only toothed species out of the group of the great whales, reached a peak of
29,255 animals taken in 1963-64 and was hunted at numbers above 20,000 until 1981-82. The smallest of the
commercial species called the Minke whale - not included in the BWU either - started to be harvested only in
1971 with a steady number of 6,000 to 9,000 individuals taken each year. No significant decline is visible
towards the end of the data period, and it is believed that Minke whales occur in abundant levels in the ocean to
this day.
Overall, the total amount of whales harvested between 1909-10 and 1983-84 displays a culminating peak with
two significant drops in 1931-32 and 1941-42 to 1944-45. The first drop occurred due to an overproduction of

oil, which swamped the market, inducing a price drop, and the establishment of first inter-company quota
agreements at 16,000 BWUs. The second drop signified the period of World War II where whaling was ceased
by nearly all harvesting nations, only to be resumed again until an absolute peak of 66,026 harvested whales in
the 1961-62 season was reached. Thereafter, catch figures declined steadily until only 9,893 individuals could be
caught in 1982 – the year the International Whaling Commission approved of the moratorium. Within the data
period of 72 years, a grand total of 2,497,143 whales were persecuted, killed and processed – a figure that
reveals the massive scale of global whaling activity.

In total, about 29 countries participated in whaling activities since the beginning of the 20th century, most of
them only on a minor scale, while just a handful of nations made up the bulk of the harvest. It is interesting to
note that each whaling country or region is characterised by a hump-shaped curve, where an initial period of
rapidly increasing numbers taken culminates in a single peak or short-term high level before dropping again as
rapidly as it rose, albeit distributed across time for the various countries. Norway and Britain shared a relatively
similar whaling path due to their long-standing tradition of fishing and whaling. Up to the 1950s these two
nations dominated the whaling industry, harvesting mainly Blue and Fin whales. With fast depreciating whaling
equipment and successively lower numbers caught, Britain and Norway suspended pelagic whaling at the
beginning of the 1960s, selling their catchers and floating factories to Japan and Russia. Japan entered pelagic
whaling shortly before the war and harvested substantial numbers throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with its main
prey species being the Fin and Sei whale. Japan consumed baleen whales not only for their oil as an input into
margarine and other related food products but also for their traditionally eaten meat, especially during post-war
famine conditions. Japan's peak harvest was 24,468 whales taken in 1964-65, just shortly after the worldwide
peak in whaling in 1961-62, suggesting that Japan was one of the main agents in the culminating exploitation
towards the end. Similarly, Russia concentrated mainly on sperm whales for their oil as specialised lubricants.
Russia entered the fray just after the second World War, peaking a year later than Japan with 21,313 animals
killed in 1965-66. Each with only three factories left in the Antarctic in the 1960s, Russia and Japan were the last
nations to withdraw from big-scale whaling towards the end of the 1970s – and hence the ones lodging the most
vehement obligations against the moratorium.
Whale stocks
Common sense dictates that one of the most crucial factors determining the development path of whaling over
time will be the yearly change in whale stock levels. As stocks decline so harvesting costs should rise. Stock data
on the various species in the different hunting areas over such a long stretch of time are practically impossible to
come by - even the International Whaling Commission withdrew any former publications of stock assessments
due to scientific uncertainties. Nonetheless, it is necessary to make some attempt at estimating stocks, however
approximate, in order to establish that the stock effect on harvest costs exists. Bockstoce and Botkin (1983)

produced historical stock estimates for the Arctic Bowhead whale population between 1848 and 1914. Using
their methodology, we estimate overall yearly stock levels in the Antarctic since the onset of pelagic whaling.
Making up 60-80% of the whaling harvest, the Antarctic whaling grounds represent a sufficient indicator for the
collapse of whale stocks world-wide. Given the vast uncertainties - biologically as well as statistically - the
estimates have to be treated with caution. Nevertheless, since we are essentially interested in changes in
population levels, rather than absolute levels, the figures should give some reliable indication as to the behaviour
of whale stocks in response to the pelagic exploitation in the Antarctic.
Ever since the International Whaling Commission formed the ‘Special Committee of Three’ scientists from nonwhaling nations in 1960, the correct assessment of whale stocks has been a controversial issue amongst scholars
of population dynamics. The management of whale populations distinguishes itself from that of normal fisheries
in respect of various biological aspects, but mainly due to the fact that whales have a very steady - albeit much
lower - rate of reproduction than most fish. Assuming that on average a whale is born every other year, the gross
addition to the stock will rarely exceed 25% of the number of adults, since the sex ratio is estimated to be about
even at birth (Gulland, 1974). A low reproduction rate implies a rather low natural mortality rate. The age of
maturity depends on the species but is usually quite high (8 to 10 years for Sei whales). Given the uncertainties
about the biology of whales, most of the early analysis by the Committee of Three relied heavily upon 'Catch Per
Unit of Effort' (CPUE) data, used as an index of stock abundance. The earliest and probably simplest approach
was developed by Leslie and Davis (1939) and DeLury (1947) – the so-called unmodified DeLury method –
where a population estimate is obtained from the catch and effort data alone. This technique is used in standard
analysis, providing a stock assessment based on four stringent assumptions. First, the rate of recruitment and
natural mortality is negligible compared to the catch and can thus be ignored, i.e. sampling is done from a closed
population. Second, ‘catchability’ remains constant during the sampling period, i.e. any individual whale is as
likely to be caught as any other, and its catchability does not vary over time. Third, there is no competition
between vessels, i.e. they do not interfere with one another or otherwise compete. Fourth, the catch represents a
significant proportion of the population, i.e. the method depends upon the decrease in the CPUE bearing a direct
relationship to the decline in population
DeLury suggested that estimates of the abundance of a population can be made assuming that, for a given
population size, there is a constant relationship between the number of animals caught and the effort expended in
catching them. With a constant relationship between catch and effort, changes in CPUE should give a direct
indication of changing population levels, i.e. the CPUE will decrease monotonically as the population decreases.
With the crucial assumption of a closed population in mind, CPUE in successive years is plotted against the
accumulated catch, and a least-squares linear regression line is fitted to the points and extrapolated to CPUE = 0.
The intercept on the accumulated catch scale will then give an estimate of the initial population size. Formally,

U t = kN 0 − kCt
and

N0 = a / b
where Ut is the CPUE in season t, Ct is the catch in season t, N0 is the initial population size in the total
Antarctic and k is the proportion of the population captured by one unit of effort in t=0 (a = kN0 and b =k).
Since the development of the DeLury approach several authors have modified the model to incorporate estimates
of recruitment and natural mortality. Chapman’s (1974) extension of the method assumes constant, and
therefore density-independent recruitment equal to MNo , i.e. the mortality rate multiplied by the initial
population size. Once a value for N0 has been obtained, one can calculate the catchability coefficient q = a/N0
where a = qN0, b = q then a/b = N0. The q method can then be used to obtain an estimate of the mean population
size Nt* during each season t.
As noted earlier, there has been a change over the years in catcher efficiency due to technological change in the
form of increased power, speed, navigational aids, increasing technological experience of the crew and increased
capacity of factory ships. To correct for the increasing efficiency of catchers, a simple regression of CPUE
against increasing horse power per catcher - which indicates increasing catcher efficiency - reveals insignificant
coefficients within a 95% confidence interval and an extremely low adjusted R-squared value (Table 1), i.e.
catcher efficiency seems to be relatively insignificant, and can safely be ignored when applying CPUE data to
the assessment of whale stocks.

The results of the unmodified DeLury method are shown in Table 2. The results appear quite promising with
highly significant coefficients for the intercept and accumulated catch at 95% significance level, yielding an
estimated initial stock level of 3,203,385 animals in the Antarctic. Unfortunately, use of Chapman's modified
approach did not yield significant results so there has to be added caution in accepting the estimates based on
DeLury.

Taking the DeLury model estimates, and applying the q method to obtain an estimate of the mean population
size during the first few seasons after the start of pelagic whaling in 1919-20 in the Antarctic, figures for stock
size vary between 2 and 3 million. Results obtained by Duxbury and Duxbury (1991) and various others of
pristine populations of each separate species, i.e. Blue, Fin, Humpback, Minke, Sei and Sperm whale, add up to
about 2,450,000 individuals - a number that gives confidence in the estimate.
Caution has to be exercised when using DeLury’s method since there is one prominent factor that can violate the
assumption of a closed population. The population is likely to have a significant density-dependent reproduction
response so that as the population is harvested in the beginning the net recruitment rate increases, whilst it
declines towards the end of severe exploitation until reaching a point of collapse4. Also, the population sampled
might not represent the entire stock, or a fraction of the population sampled varies over time with the
immigration of prey species and changes with the distribution of whaling ships. Ideally, a model should contain
variables representing age and sex structure of whale stocks since for any long-lived species such structure may
have significant effects on its short-term and long-term populations. Given our current knowledge, such
information is highly speculative and one has to resort to a very simple model to mimic such conditions.

4
The assumption of a density-dependent effect can lead to a distorted estimate of the DeLury method when applied to longer time periods
than 7 to 10 years. However, it is also true that the shorter the time period, the less likely is it to obtain a statistically significant regression
line. Following Bockstoce and Botkin (1983) the DeLury method was estimated with various sets of time periods with the result that highest
statistically significance was achieved when applying all 64 observations.

To allow for density-dependent and time-lagged recruitment, Bockstoce and Botkin’s model was followed,
incorporating annual changes in population levels due to causes other than pelagic whaling. Thus,

∆Nt = Nt-1 r (1 - (Nt-lag / No) )
where
r
= rate of increase of recruitment
lag
= lag time in years.
The population in each year t is then calculated by adding the annual change, ∆Nt, and subtracting the number of
whales estimated to have been harvested in that year:
Nt = ∆Nt + Nt-1 - C
Figure 3 shows the stock assessment results: using a time lag of 2 - as on average a whale is borne every other
year - and a range of net recruitment rates of 3% (N3t), 5% (N5t) and 7% (N7t)5, the effects of densitydependent and time-lagged recruitment are clearly significant as shown by the graph. Although qualitative
outcomes are not affected whether the q method (Nqt) or the density-dependent, time-lagged method is used, i.e.
stocks rise in the beginning as a reaction to modest harvesting, then decline at a steady and slow rate until
exploitation induces a severe drop similar to the sudden collapse of ecological systems, quantitative outcomes
are. The use of different recruitment rates seems to have a marginal impact on the path of density-dependent,
time-lagged recruitment. Compared to the path using the q method, however, density-dependent recruitment first
follows the q method path closely, as expected, but then declines more severely displaying the density effect of
less abundant recruitment - shifted by two years due to the time lag.

5

Intrinsic growth rates of whale populations are assumed to be in the range of 2% to 7% with the intuitive explanation that if the sex ratio is
even at birth (Gulland, 1974), and females reproduce every other year, only 1/4 would reproduce in any given year. But when there is a long
pre-puberty period and a large fraction of the population is immature, the actual fraction of females ready to conceive is much smaller. Also,
calving intervals are often longer than two years and females may die whilst pregnant, which gives an upper bound of a definitely not more
than 10% and rarely as much as 5% net recruitment rate (Bockstoce and Botkin, 1983).

Intuitively, the path calculated allowing for density-dependent, time-lagged recruitment seems more reasonable,
and regression results will reveal their statistical significance.

A brief history of regulation
Armed with catch data and the somewhat tentative estimates of stocks, we now proceed to investigate the
economic and institutional factors that might explain changes in the stock levels. First, we focus on regulatory
efforts to control whaling.
Since the onset of industrial exploitation in the Antarctic in 1925, whaling took place for many years without
regulation under the ‘doctrine of the freedom of fishing on the high seas’, which included free access to fish and
therefore whales (whales being regarded as fish). This doctrine, effectively giving the whale the status of an
open-access resource, was confirmed in the Bering Fur Seal Case in 1893. In 1930 the International Council for
the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) encouraged the League of Nations to adopt a Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling promoting ‘scientific research as input to regulation’, which was ratified by eighteen states when it
came into effect in 1935. The effective implementation of this initial agreement was obstructed by various
factors, including non-participation by Japan and Germany. Nevertheless, the Convention did succeed in
granting absolute protection to Gray and Right whales, and provided for the first time combined efforts for the
collection of statistical information and introduced a quota system based on the Blue Whale Unit (BWU).
With an overall catch limit set at 16,000 BWUs applied ‘to all the waters in the world’, contracting whale oil
production seemed to indicate successful measures, but with the effect of disastrous effects on conservation
grounds. Whalers concentrated upon the largest individuals, since they yielded the largest amount of oil, thereby
successively driving down target species to commercial extinction. Although further measures were introduced
at a second conference in 1937, London, such as the prohibition of catching females accompanied by calves and
the closure of waters north of 40 °S (except for the North Pacific) to pelagic whaling, they only aggravated the
fierce competition between whalers to get the maximum catch within the given restrictions.
With the outbreak of World War II from 1939 to 1945, whaling ceased temporarily but was resumed again in
1944 with Norway, Britain, the Soviet Union, Japan, South Africa and Holland taking the lead. The quota was
kept at 16,000 BWUs, and according to Birnie (1989) it might have been the ‘more internationalist climate of
world opinion’ after the war that helped to establish the first real legal basis on which future whale protection
was based. On 2nd December 1946, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) was
signed by fifteen nations, but ratified by only nine nations when the Convention came into force on 1st July,
1948. This Convention displayed an amalgam of prior fisheries treaties, with the underlying assertion that
whaling was still to be regarded as some sort of fishing, therefore retaining the doctrine of the freedom of the
seas. Also, the document made clear that that the preservation and expansion of the whaling industry by means
of conserving stocks was its chief objective, rather than conservation itself. With no specific restrictions or
quotas being applied to nations, whaling units or whale species, a 90 days notification period of objection as
well as the possibility for any contracting government to ratify, adhere or withdraw at any time, real conservation
measures were effectively given second priority in favour of managing the profitability of oil production in the
long run. Nevertheless, the establishment of the IWC, a formal schedule and a collective body responsible for
whaling statistics were an important step towards the formal acknowledgement of the need to conduct scientific
research and introduce careful management procedures.
Over the next two decades it became obvious that the IWC had done little to stop the further decline of some
species, whilst successively maintaining the industry on the more abundant ones. Also, the extent to which
member nations adhered to these regulations was increasingly questioned by the public, and in 1962 – with a
total number of 38,552 whales taken in the Antarctic - whale stocks showed the first signs of a dramatic collapse.
In 1968 only 15,080 were caught. In 1963, the committee of three scientists (later four) set up in 1961 urged the
IWC to take more dramatic measures in the management of the remaining whale stocks, such as a complete ban
on Humpback and Blue whales. The IWC did respond by introducing some restrictions, but it was only in 1972,
when the whale had become an increasingly politicised animal, that the United Nations Conference on the
Human Environment in Stockholm called for a ten year moratorium on whaling. The IWC rejected this
proposition with six of its contracting governments voting against, four in favour and four abstaining. At the
same time, the U.S.A. passed its Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibited the taking or importing of
marine mammals and products except by subsistence based cultures, such as the Indians and Aleuts. Potentially
the most influential international environmental agreement, however, was the establishment of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), signed in 1973, and put into

force in 1975. With forty-six countries participating in the Convention, CITES gave full protection to Gray
whales, two Right whale species, Humpback, Blue whales and some stocks of Fin and Sei whales. Under public
pressure, the IWC at last abandoned the BWU quota system in the Antarctic (it was never used in regions other
than the Antarctic), and in 1973 separate quotas were set for Fin, Sei, Minke and Sperm whales for the first time.
At this point Britain and Holland, followed by Norway had pulled out of pelagic whaling, leaving only Japan and
the Soviet Union as the main whaling nations.
Global pressure from scientists, environmentalists and the public mounted, and a World Consultation held in
Bergen, Norway by the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 1976 highlighted the extremely poor status of
many stocks, emphasising the complexity of whale biology and population dynamics given the ecological
interrelationships of stocks within the marine environment as a whole. With further pressure on the IWC from
other international conservation treaties and conventions, such as the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources in 1979, the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in the same year, the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982, the United Nations Convention in the World Charter for Nature in the
same year and various other, the ICRW was no longer the sole relevant treaty for the protection of whales,
although it remained the most important one. Finally, as conservationist Non- and Inter-Governmental
Organisations encouraged non-whaling states to join the IWC to augment the numbers in favour of a cessation
of commercial whaling, a moratorium on all commercial whaling was achieved at the 34th annual meeting of the
IWC in 1982. With the avoidance of any suggestion that the cessation would be permanent, a three-quarters
majority decided to set zero quotas starting from the 1985/1986 pelagic season – with the possibility of resuming
whaling left open. The Soviet Union, Japan and Norway lodged obligations but had to bow to the intense
political and public pressure that slowly culminated in the uncompromising demand of the global community to
save the whale.
How effective was regulation?
To stem the tide of declining stocks, an initial quota of 16,000 BWUs was set in 1932 specifically applied to the
activities of pelagic whaling in the Antarctic. This quota remained unchanged until 1954 and was lowered only
marginally to not more than 15,000 BWUs until 1960. In that year, quotas were suspended for two successive
years in an attempt to entice Norway and the Netherlands back into the IWC, who had withdrawn in protest in
1957 due to quota reductions and disagreements about Antarctic catch allocations among the whaling nations. At
the same time, an independent Committee of three scientists was established, and they called for drastic action in
order to halt the decline of stocks. Quotas were lowered in successive years thereafter down to 2,300 BWUs, but
given the IWC’s weak international legal status, overharvesting continued until 1972, when finally the BWU
system was abolished in favour of species-specific quotas.

Season

Figure 4 displays whale catch over the years converted into BWUs, thereby enabling a direct comparison to the
quotas set. Surprisingly, though not adhered to before the war, quotas did seem to have an impact on after-war
catch. Catch worldwide, pelagic and total Antarctic, follow the movements of set quotas very closely, exhibiting
a plateau of a stable amount of BWUs harvested between 1948 and 1962, before displaying a sharp crash. With
quotas set specifically for the pelagic whaling season, it is even more surprising to observe that pelagic catch in
terms of BWU seems to match the catch prescribed by regulation precisely, giving the impression that regulation
was effective. However, with collapsing stocks in 1962, it is more plausible that BWU quotas were set far too
high from the start, mimicking feasible catch rather than imposing stringent regulations. Especially after 1962,
actual catch was continuously below the quotas set, indicating that the IWC had merely codified the chosen
whaling development path. Maybe the IWC did have some effect, in that it smoothed out catch over time, rather
than allowing a drastic increase followed by a drastic decline - as was the case before the war. Most definitely,
however, the IWC did nothing to stop the exploitation of successive target species motivated by the fixed level
of BWU quotas. Also, within the BWU system only four species were considered - ignoring the exploitation of
other species such as Minke, Bryde’s and Sperm whales. Enforcement by some states was suspected to be very
poor and there was ‘piratical’ catching by non-members, as well as corrupted figures supplied by whaling
nations. Knowing the political difficulties of reducing quotas, there is a further suspicion that the Scientific
Committee tempered its own advice and was not truly taken seriously until 1975, when the New Management
Procedure was introduced.
Environmental activism
The World Consultation on Marine Mammals held in Bergen, Norway, in 1976, highlighted the extremely poor
status of many whale stocks, and marked the start of an era in which environmental awareness began to have a
significant impact on whaling. The changing perception of whales manifested itself in the new moral approach of
‘saving’ as opposed to ‘killing’ the whale. Strong anti-whaling positions became a rather convenient way of
portraying a green image as virtually no material cost were involved for nations without

whaling interests. The successful negotiation of a world-wide moratorium in 1982 was helped by one crucial
institutional factor: the IWC was an ‘inclusive’ organisation, where according to Article X any nation may
become member irrespective of its whaling interest. Until the end of the 1970s, the number of member nations
remained relatively stable with around fifteen to sixteen members. Although non-whaling nations had always
been in the majority, they were usually short of a three-quarters majority to amend the Schedule against the will
of the few crucial whaling nations. Towards the end of the 1970s, however, membership numbers grew rapidly
reaching a level of nearly forty participating governments in 1982 - see Figure 5.
The IWC found itself suddenly in a situation where non-whaling nations reached an overwhelming majority,
transforming it from a club of ex-whalers to one of preservationists. At the same time a sharply increasing
number of NGOs and other organisations started to attend the annual meetings of the IWC, most notably in 1980
when the number jumped from just under ten delegates to forty-five, rising even further up to sixty-two in 1985.
With a new element of strong emotional concern entering the decision making process of the IWC, the by now
isolated whaling nations had to bow to the immense pressure of the media and the public resulting in a worldwide moratorium in 1982. However, Figure 5 shows that the environmental movement occurred far too late to
stop the collapse of stocks shortly after 1962. Nevertheless, growing environmental awareness seems to have
played a crucial force in averting complete extinction.
An econometric model
Given the inverted ‘U’ shaped curve of whale catch over time suggested by whaling statistics, we now seek to
explain the factors accounting for the whaling trajectory between the early 1950s and the 1970s. Game theorists
have argued that self-enforcing international environmental agreements, which establish conservation measures
for managing shared environmental resources, may not be able to improve substantially upon the status quo
when the number of countries that share the resource is very large (Barrett, 1994). If so, we might expect
international whaling regulation, as represented by the International Whaling Commission, to have been
relatively impotent with respect to the sustainable management of whale stocks. We test this hypothesis by
quantifying preferences (represented by income), substitutes (i.e. prices of whale oil and competing oils),
dynamic stock effects, environmental activism and international regulation serving as potential explanatory
variables.

We adopt an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model which seeks to choose the sample regression equation that
minimises the residuals. Given the occurrence of World War II, which in statistical terms can be seen as an
outlier, and the fact that most of the available data sets cover the years of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, especially with
respect to the price indices of whale, fish and vegetable oil, estimations are applied to the 28 years between the
1945-46 season (marked by the establishment of the ICRW after the war) and the 1972-73 season (the time when
the BWU system was abolished). This period captures the most crucial years of the whaling development path,
with steeply rising whale catch from 1945 onwards, peaking in 1962 and dropping drastically thereafter only to
reveal an extremely poor status of stocks in 1972.

Having performed various regressions systematically checking for significance by using explanatory variables
interchangeably, the best model was identified to be:
catcht = α + βrgdpct + χrgdpct2 + δrgdpct3 + φstockqt + γbwut + ε
Using stock5 instead of stockq yields consistently insignificant coefficients, bwu turns out to be insignificant in
almost all instances but increases the goodness of fit of the model when included, and activism turns out to be
consistently insignificant as well as decreasing the adjusted R-squared value when included. Also, as soon as
logarithms of whale oil, fish oil, vegetable oil and its various subgroups of oil are added – either separately or
jointly – they distort all other parameters, making them insignificant, as well as consistently exhibiting
insignificant coefficients of their own.
The results of the regression are shown in Table 4.

The elicited model exhibits a high adjusted R-squared value at 0.8512, with an F-value below the 5% critical
value and all coefficients being highly significant apart from regulation. As suspected, collapsing whale stocks
seem to play the crucial role in the development path of the whaling industry, whilst prices of whale oil and the
various substitutes matter only insignificantly and thus have been dropped from the model. Regulation, also,
seems to play a rather ineffective role and activism, as argued before, came far too late to have had any effect on
the depletion of whale resources before their collapse in the late 60s.
An interesting insight gained is the existence of a powerful relationship between real income and whale catch.
Time is related to income in that GDP per capita rises as economies go through the stages of development, and
since whaling clearly exhibits an inverted-U shape relationship over the course of time, a potent relationship
between income and whale catch can be observed. At relatively low levels of income, the number of whales
caught rises due to the renewable resource being utilised as a factor of production satisfying the need for oil as
an input into food. However, having passed a certain ‘turning point’ higher levels of income are associated with
rising public demand to conserve the resource due to its conservation value – whales are perceived as a factor of
enrichment to the biodiversity of the environment, outweighing their use in production. Indeed, the whale
watching industry has been a fast growing business, attracting some nine million enthusiasts in 87 countries in
the year 2000 and generating a record-breaking US$ 1 billion in revenue
Preceding the turning point, the linear effect dominates, implying a decline of the resource, whilst after the
turning point the quadratic effect outweighs the linear one, stimulating conservation due to the dual nature of the
marine resources. It is the composition of output and the methods of production that play a crucial role. As
scarcity bites, technological advance and substitution are able to offset the effect of increased economic activity
on the resource. The significance of income cubed implies a second turning point, albeit quantitatively much less
influential before the world-wide moratorium in 1982 eventually set an end to the harvest.
Conclusions
The ancient tradition of whaling handed down to the generations of the 20th century, coupled with technological
advances, created an industry that thrived on the unsustainable harvest of a marine species pushed to the brink of
extinction. Attempts to stop the progressive over-exploitation were reflected in the establishment of the IWC.
With member nations mainly concerned about short-term profits rather than sustainable catch, it is not so much
the IWC itself that is to blame for failing to put a halt on excessive harvest, but rather the common problem of
self-interest, lack of enforcement and free-riding in international environmental agreements. The collapse of
Antarctic whale stocks in the early 1960s attracted global media attention, creating a new environmental
awareness and turning the whale into a symbol of unified conservation effort. With the enforcement of a worldwide moratorium in the early 1980s, whales were granted exclusive protection in order to let stocks recover. But
the issue addressed in this paper is the extent to which the moratorium did more than 'rubber stamp' a situation
that had already emerged.
Whaling statistics suggest an inverted ‘U’ shaped curve of catch over time, raising questions with respect to the
role of economic conditions and policy formulation leading to the collapse of the industry. Our analysis
concentrates on the construction and elicitation of stock levels, regulation, prices of whale oil and substitutes,
environmental activism and income growth serving as potential explanatory variables. Simple regression
estimations suggest that regulation was not important in stabilising populations. Rather, economic growth
brought with it a declining demand for whale products, whilst and decreasing stock levels fed back into more and
more expensive harvesting effort, making whaling generally uneconomic.

The econometric results suggest the impotence of regulation in the form of international environmental
agreements, but stress the importance of economic growth, implying that, to some extent, economies can
‘outgrow’ severe environmental exploitation. Economic growth represents the phenomenon of continuously
advancing technological progress, which diverts demand away from ‘inferior’ products and motivates growing
environmental awareness, i.e. as basic needs are satisfied, economic growth produces a change in preferences in
favour of environmental goods. Our results therefore lend some support for the 'Environmental Kuznets Curve'
hypothesis that environmental degradation proceeds as an inverted 'U' shaped curve when measured against real
per capita incomes, cross sectionally or over time. Nonetheless, it would be foolish to argue that economic
growth alone will secure an eventually stable environment. While international agreements may have limited
effectiveness, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that domestic policies are potent ways of 'tunnelling through'
the Environmental Kuznets Curve (Panayotou, 1996).
