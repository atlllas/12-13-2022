Global warming is rapidly emerging as the most prominent threat to the ecological integrity

22

of the world’s coral reefs1-4 , highlighting the need for a better understanding of the impact of

23

heat exposure on the resilience of reef ecosystems and the people who depend on them. Here

24

we reveal the non-linear responses of coral assemblages to a wide array of heat exposures,

25

which arises as their resistance to low levels of stress is increasingly exceeded at higher

26

exposures, resulting in a catastrophic collapse of coral abundances and functions. In the

27

aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 20165 , corals

28

began to die immediately where accumulated heat stress exceeded a critical threshold of 3-4

29

o C-weeks (Degree

30

between 40% and 90% of their coral cover. An exposure of 6 °C-weeks or more drove an

31

unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting

32

markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. These abrupt shifts have

33

transformed the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs

34

comprising the world’s largest coral reef system. In the northern third of the Great Barrier

35

Reef, where temperature anomalies in 2016 were the most extreme, the collapse of all major

36

coral taxa is unlikely to be fully reversed in the foreseeable future because of the increasing

37

frequency of marine heatwaves6 . Post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical

38

shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, adding to but far exceeding the impact of

39

recurrent cyclones and other local events, representing a fundamental challenge to the long-

40

term future of these iconic ecosystems.

41

Heating Weeks). After eight months, sites exposed to 4-10 o C-weeks lost

3
42

Marine heatwaves due to global warming have triggered pan-tropical bleaching of corals in

43

1998, 2010 and 2015/20166 , and acute thermal stress is rapidly emerging as the most

44

widespread threat to the world’s coral reefs2-4,7 . Bleaching occurs when the relationship

45

between corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium spp.)

46

breaks down, turning the coral pale. Bleached corals are physiologically damaged and

47

nutritionally compromised, and they can die if bleaching is severe and recovery of their

48

symbionts is prolonged8,9 . However, the relationships between heat exposure and the

49

subsequent mortality of different taxa is not well understood or quantified. While the concept

50

of winners versus losers has been widely applied to describe inter-specific differences in the

51

degree of bleaching11-14 , predicting the definitive losers, namely the corals that fail to regain

52

their colour and ultimately die following heat stress, is key to understanding how climate

53

change affects biodiversity, species composition and ecosystem function. To date, no study

54

has examined the quantitative relationship between a broad range of heat exposures and the

55

response of coral assemblages. The shape of this response curve is essential for identifying

56

critical levels of heat exposure when the initial resistance of different taxa is overcome, and

57

for predicting what further amount of heat exposure could drive a transformation in species

58

composition and ecological functions. Here, we examine geographic patterns of heat

59

exposure and differential mortality of coral taxa along the 2,300 km length of the Great

60

Barrier Reef, arising during the record-breaking marine heatwave of 20165 . We show that

61

taxonomic patterns of bleaching did not predict the identity of the ultimate losers that died,

62

that many corals succumbed immediately from heat stress as well as more slowly following

63

the depletion of their zooxanthellae, and that heat stress drove a radical shift in the

64

composition and functional traits of coral assemblages on hundreds of individual reefs,

65

transforming large swaths of the remote northern third of the Great Barrier Reef from mature

66

and diverse assemblages to a new, degraded system. This altered ecosystem is unlikely to

4
67

have sufficient time to recover to its original pre-bleaching configuration in the face of future,

68

recurrent climate-driven disturbances.

69

The 2016 bleaching event triggered an unprecedented loss of corals on the northern third of

70

the Great Barrier Reef, and to a lesser extent, the central third, with virtually no heat-stress

71

mortality occurring further south (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1, 2). The geographic footprint

72

and intensity of the coral die-off (Fig. 1a) closely matched by the observed north-south

73

pattern in accumulated heat (Fig. 1b), measured as satellite-derived Degree Heating Weeks

74

(DHW, o C-weeks), a widely-used measure that incorporates both the duration and intensity of

75

heat stress15 . The 5 km-resolution DHW values (Fig. 1b) were significantly correlated with

76

the independently-estimated losses of corals on 1,156 reefs (Fig. 1a; r2 = 0.50, p < 0.001). In

77

the northern, 700 km-long section of the Great Barrier Reef (from 9.5-14.5o S), where the heat

78

exposure was the most extreme, 50.3% of the coral cover on reef crests was lost within eight

79

months (Fig. 1b). More broadly, in the 1,200 km extent of the northern and central regions

80

where the bleaching had occurred in March (from 9.5-19.5o S), the decrease by November

81

was 38.2%, and throughout the entire Great Barrier Reef, including the southern third of the

82

Reef where heat exposure was minimal (Fig. 1b), the cover of corals declined by 30.0%

83

between March and November 2016. In comparison, the massive loss of corals from the

84

2016 marine heatwave was an order of magnitude greater and more widespread than the

85

patchier damage that typically occurs on reefs sites within the track of a severe tropical

86

cyclone16 .

87

At the scale of individual reefs, the severity of coral mortality was also highly correlated with

88

the amount of bleaching, and with the level of heat exposure (Fig. 2). Initially, at the peak of

89

temperatures extremes in March 2016, many tens of millions of corals died quickly in the

90

northern half of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of just 2-3 weeks (Fig. 2a). These

91

widespread losses were not due to slow attrition of corals that failed to regain their

5
92

symbionts. Rather, thermally-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately

93

where they were exposed to heat stress of >4°C-weeks (Fig. 1b, Fig. 2a). The amount of

94

initial mortality increased steadily with increasing heat exposure (r2 = 0.50, p < 0.001); where

95

the exposure was <4° C-weeks, fewer than 5% of the corals died, whereas we recorded an

96

initial median loss of 15.6% of corals on reefs with 4-8 °C-weeks exposure, and a median

97

loss of 27.0% of corals at locations that experienced >8 °C-weeks (Fig. 2a). Across the entire

98

Great Barrier Reef, 34.8% of individual reefs experienced >4 °C-weeks, and 20.7% of reefs

99

were exposed to >8 °C-weeks DHW (Fig. 1a). The amount of initial mortality at the peak of

100

summer varied strikingly among different groups of corals, and was highest for Pocillopora

101

damicornis, two species of Isopora, Stylophora pistillata, and staghorn Acropora (Extended

102

Data Figure 4a).

103

During the ensuing Austral winter, the bleached corals in the northern and central Great

104

Barrier Reef either slowly regained their colour and survived, or they continued to die at

105

unprecedented levels. Only a handful, <1%, remained bleached after eight months. The

106

severity of the longer-term loss of corals, measured in situ as the decline in coral cover

107

between March and November, was accurately predicted by the percent of corals that were

108

initially bleached (Fig. 2b; r2 = 0.51, p < 0.001). Specifically, reefs that experienced less than

109

25% bleaching in March typically had almost no loss of cover after eight months (Fig. 2b). In

110

contrast, above this threshold, the loss of coral cover increased progressively, indicating that

111

fewer of the bleached corals survived. Furthermore, the longer-term loss of coral cover

112

accelerated with increasing levels of heat exposure of each reef (DHW, r2 = 0.44, P <0.001;

113

Fig. 2c). Consequently, we recorded almost no loss of coral cover for reefs exposed to 0-3

114

°C-weeks, compared with a 40% decline at 4° C-weeks, 66% for 8 °C-weeks, and extreme

115

declines of >80% for exposures of >9 °C-weeks. The non-linear responses to heat exposure

6
116

varied significantly among coral taxa (Extended Data Fig. 5), illustrating a spectrum of

117

surivorship among winners versus losers, driving a radical shift in species composition.

118

Post-bleaching mortality has disproportionately transformed the assemblage structure and

119

functional diversity of corals on reefs that experienced high levels of bleaching (affecting

120

>60% of colonies), as illustrated by a non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis

121

(Fig. 3). The abundances of all categories of corals decreased to varying degrees on these

122

heavily bleached reefs, shown by the orientation of the nMDS vectors (Fig. 3a) and the

123

directional shift in the before-after assemblages (Fig. 3b). Tabular and staghorn Acropora,

124

Seriatopora hystrix and Stylophora pistillata - fast-growing, three-dimensional, weedy

125

species that dominate many shallow Indo-Pacific reefs – all declined by >75% (Extended

126

Data Fig. 4b). In contrast to the radical shifts on heavily bleached reefs, assemblages changed

127

very little between March and November on reefs that experienced moderate (30-60%) or

128

little (0-30%) bleaching. On these reefs, the nMDS analysis of before and after assemblages

129

shows that shifts in composition were small and multi-directional (Fig. 3c).

130

The response curve of coral assemblages exposed to a range of heat exposures, from 0-10o C-

131

weeks, (measured as the Euclidean distance between before and after compositions on each

132

reef (Fig. 3b, c)), is strikingly non-linear (Fig. 4). The changes in assemblage structure after

133

eight months were small on reefs that were exposed to DHW <6 °C-weeks, whereas reefs

134

subjected to >6 °C-weeks lost >50% of their corals (Fig. 2c) and shifted dramatically in

135

composition (Fig. 4). Satellite-derived DHW data indicate that 28.6% of the 3,863 reefs

136

comprising the Great Barrier Reef experienced thermal exposures of >6° C-weeks during the

137

2016 bleaching event, and 20.7% (800 reefs) were exposed to >8 °C-weeks (Fig. 1).

138

Individual reefs with this severity of heat exposure have undergone an unprecedented

139

ecological collapse, extending southwards from Papua New Guinea for up to 1,000 km (Fig.

7
140

1). Reefs that were exposed to <6 °C-weeks were located predominantly in the southern half

141

of the Great Barrier Reef, and in a small northern patch at the outer edge of the continental

142

shelf where temperature anomalies in 2016 above the long-term summer maximum were

143

small (Fig. 1b).

144

The abrupt, geographic-scale shift in coral assemblages has also radically reduced the

145

abundance and diversity of species traits that facilitate key ecological functions (Fig. 3d-e,

146

Extended Data Table 1, 2). A before-after analysis of the multi-dimensional trait space of

147

coral assemblages, weighted by the absolute abundance of taxa contributing to each trait,

148

reveals a transformation in the functional-trait composition of assemblages on heavily

149

bleached reefs (affecting >60% of colonies) in the eight month period after March 2016

150

(Fig. 3e). In most cases, reefs shifted away from the dominance of fast-growing, three-

151

dimensional, branching and tabular species with dense skeletons, to a depauperate

152

assemblage dominated by taxa with simpler morphological characteristics and slower

153

growth rates. In contrast, on less-bleached reefs the weighted abundances of functionally

154

important traits typically showed small gains (Fig. 3f).

155

In conclusion, our analyses show that acute heat stress from global warming is a potent driver

156

of a geographic-scale collapse of coral assemblages, affecting even the most remote and well-

157

protected reefs within an iconic World Heritage Area. Forecasts of coral bleaching made

158

continuously by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are

159

accompanied with guidance that a DHW exposure of 4o C-weeks usually results in significant

160

bleaching, and 8 °C-weeks may also cause mortality of corals1,15,17 . We show here that

161

substantial mortality occurred on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 well below 8 °C-weeks

162

(beginning at 3-4 °C-weeks, Fig. 2c), and that the resistance of coral assemblages to heat

163

exposure increasingly collapsed above 6 °C-weeks, triggering large-scale shifts in the

8
164

composition and ecological functions of reefs (Fig. 3). The threshold we have identified for

165

the breakdown of assemblage structure, approximately 6 °C-weeks (Fig. 4), was transgressed

166

in 2016 throughout most of the northern, as well as much of the central, region of the Great

167

Barrier Reef (Fig. 1). The prospects for a full recovery to the pre-bleaching coral

168

assemblages before the next major bleaching event are poor, for several reasons. First, many

169

of the surviving coral colonies continue to die slowly even after recovery of their algal

170

symbionts, because they have lost extensive patches of tissue, are injured and fragmented,

171

and because corals weakened by bleaching are susceptible to subsequent outbreaks of

172

disease18,19 . Secondly, the replacement of dead corals by larval recruitment and subsequent

173

colony growth will take at least a decade for weedy corals, such as species of Acropora,

174

Pocillopora, Seriatopora and Stylophora10,20,21 . The success of future recruitment will depend

175

upon an adequate supply of larvae from lightly bleached locations, the rapid break down of

176

many millions of dead coral skeletons to provide a more enduring and stable substrate for

177

settling larvae, and the availability of suitable settlement cues and conditions for survival of

178

juvenile corals22 . Thirdly, for longer-lived, slow-growing species, the trajectory of

179

replacement of dead corals on heavily damaged reefs will be far more protracted, almost

180

certainly decades longer than the return-times of future bleaching events7 . The recurrence of

181

mass bleaching during the recovery period will be critical, in view of the global increase in

182

the frequency of bleaching events which are increasingly occurring throughout all phases of

183

El Niño Southern Oscillation cycles6 .

184

The 2015-2016 global bleaching event is a watershed for the Great Barrier Reef, and for

185

many other severely affected reefs elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific6 . Furthermore, the Great

186

Barrier Reef experienced severe bleaching again in early 2017, causing additional extensive

187

damage23,24 . The most likely scenario, therefore, is that coral reefs throughout the tropics will

188

continue to degrade over the current century until climate change stabilises4,25 , allowing

9
189

remnant populations to reorganize into novel, heat-tolerant reef assemblages. The 2016

190

marine heatwave has triggered the initial phase of that transition on the northern, most-

191

pristine region of the Great Barrier Reef (Fig. 4), changing it forever as the intensity of global

192

warming continues to escalate. The large-scale loss of functionally-diverse corals is a

193

harbinger of further radical shifts in the condition and dynamics of all marine ecosystems,

194

especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to +1.5o C above the pre-

195

industrial base-line.

Methods

334

Initial mortality and heat stress

335

We used aerial surveys, conducted in March/April 2016, to measure the geographic extent

336

and severity of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and subsequently converted the

337

bleaching scores into mortality estimates (Fig. 1a) using a calibration curve based on

338

underwater measurements of coral losses (Extended Data Fig. 1). The aerial surveys were

339

conducted throughout the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Torres Strait between

340

Australia and Papua New Guinea, from the coast of Queensland to the outermost reefs, and

341

along the entire Reef from latitudes 9.5-23.5o S. Each of 1,156 individual reefs was scored

342

into one of five bleaching categories: (0) less than 1% of corals bleached, (1) 1-10%, (2) 10-

343

30%, (3) 30-60%, and (4) more than 60% of corals bleached. The accuracy of the aerial

344

scores was ground-truthed by measuring the extent of bleaching underwater on 104 reefs,

345

also during March/April 201614, 25 .

346

We assessed underwater the initial mortality of different taxa due to heat stress, at the same

347

time as the aerial surveys, on 83 reefs that spanned the full spectrum of heat exposures and

348

bleaching. On each reef, the extent of bleaching and mortality on individual coral colonies

349

was measured at two sites using five 10 x 1 m belt transects placed on the reef crest at a depth

350

of 2 m. We identified each colony (at the species or genus level) and recorded a categorical

351

bleaching score for each one (n = 58,414 colonies): (1) no bleaching, (2) pale, (3) 1-50%

352

bleached, (4) 51-99% bleached, (5) 100% bleached, and (6) recently dead. The dead colonies

353

had suffered whole-colony mortality, were white with fully intact fine-scale skeletal features,

354

typically still had patches of rotting coral tissue, and they were experiencing the initial week

355

or two of colonization by filamentous algae, features which distinguished them from corals

356

that died earlier. The timing of our initial underwater censuses, at the peak of the bleaching in

21
357

March/April 2016, was critical for identifying corals that were dying directly from heat

358

stress, and for measuring the baseline composition of the assemblages.

359

Heat stress on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 was quantified at 5 km resolution, using the

360

NOAA Coral Reef Watch version 3 Degree Heating Week (DHW) metric15 . DHW values are

361

presented in Fig. 1b as a heat-map (Stretch type: Histogram Equalize) using inverse distance

362

weighting (IDW; Power: 2, Cell Size: 1000, Search Radius: variable, 100 points) in ArcMap

363

10.2.1.

364

Longer term mortality

365

To measure longer-term coral loss (decrease in coral cover after eight months) and its

366

relationship to the level of bleaching and heat exposure, we also conducted detailed before-

367

after assessments of taxon-specific abundances by re-visiting 63 of the 83 reefs. We

368

measured abundances in March/April and eight months later at the same locations in

369

October/November, allowing us to compare changes in coral cover for 15 ecologically and

370

taxonomically distinct components of benthic assemblages, on reefs exposed to a broad

371

spectrum of heat stress. These measurements were conducted at the same two geo-referenced

372

sites per reef, on reef crests at a depth of 2 m, using five 10 m long line-intercept transects per

373

site. There were no cyclones or flood events on the GBR during the dry-season period

374

(Austral Winter) in 2016. Unbleached reefs typically showed small increases in cover due to

375

growth, which we included in the regression analyses. Analysis of change in coral cover was

376

undertaken using the log10 -transformed ratio of final to initial cover. To improve readability

377

of Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 1, changes in coral cover are presented as percentages

378

calculated from the log-scale.

379

We compared the initial and final composition of corals using non-metric multi-dimensional

380

scaling (nMDS) based on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix of square-root transformed data,

22
381

and quantified the shift over time using the Euclidean distance between before-after

382

assemblages at each location. We then estimated the relationship between the shift in

383

composition at each reef versus the level of heat exposure experienced there (Fig. 4). To

384

include all species, the majority of which are too rare to analyse individually, we pooled them

385

into 15 ecologically cohesive groups depending on their morphology, life history, and

386

taxonomy. Three of the 15 are ubiquitous species or species complexes: Pocillopora

387

damicornis, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata. In each of the multi-species

388

groups, the dominant species or genera on reef crests were: Other Acropora (A. gemmifera, A.

389

humilis, A. loripes, A. nasuta, A. secale, A. tenuis, A. valida); Favids (i.e. species and genera

390

from the formerly recognized Family Faviidae - Cyphastrea, Favia, Favites, Goniastrea,

391

Leptastrea, Montastrea, Platygyra); Mussidae (Lobophyllia, Symphyllia); Isopora (I.

392

palifera, I. cuneata); Other Pocillopora (P. meandrina, P. verrucosa); Other sessile animals

393

(sponges, tunicates, molluscs); Porites (P. annae, P. lobata); Montipora (M. foliosa, M.

394

grisea, M. hispida, M. montasteriata, M. tuberculosa); Staghorn Acropora (A. florida, A.

395

intermedia, A. microphthalma, A. muricata, A. robusta); Soft Corals (alcyonaceans,

396

zooanthids); and Tabular Acropora (A. cytherea, A. hyacinthus, A. anthocercis).

397

We calculated longer-term mortality for all species combined at the scale of the entire Great

398

Barrier Reef in three ways, all of which yielded consistent results. The first approach (Fig.

399

1a) was based on a comparison of the observed loss of total coral cover on 63 reefs that

400

extend along the entire Great Barrier Reef measured underwater between March and

401

November, with aerial bleaching scores of the same locations in March/April (Extended Data

402

Fig. 1). This calibration allowed us to convert the aerial scores of bleaching that we recorded

403

for 1,156 reefs into mortality estimates for each of the five aerial score categories, and to map

404

the geographic footprint of losses of corals throughout the Great Barrier Reef (Fig. 1a). The

405

spatial patterns of coral decline (Fig. 1a) are presented as a heat-map of the calibrated scores

23
406

(Stretch type: Histogram Equalize) using inverse distance weighting (IDW; Power: 2, Cell

407

Size: 1000, Search Radius: variable, 100 points) in ArcMap 10.2.1.

408

The second methodology for estimating large-scale mortality is independent of aerial surveys

409

of bleaching, and based on the loss of coral cover on 110 reefs (Extended Data Fig. 2). The

410

median cover on these reefs declined between March and November from 34% to 20%

411

(Extended Data Fig. 3). For method two, the observed loss of coral cover was averaged for

412

each of eight sectors of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Torres Strait (Extended

413

Data Fig. 2), corrected for differences in reef area for each sector based on GIS data provided

414

by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and then summed to calculate the total loss.

415

For method three, we used the fitted relationship between satellite-derived Degree Heating

416

Weeks and observed change in cover (63 reefs; Fig. 2c) to score the losses or gains on all

417

3,863 individual reefs comprising the Great Barrier Reef, and averaged the total. These two

418

alternative approaches for estimating large-scale loss of cover, both based on before-after

419

underwater surveys (Extended Data Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 3) yielded consistent results

420

with Fig, 1a – a 27.7 and 29.0% decline, respectively, after 8 months.

421

Differential mortality among coral taxa

422

To estimate how exposure to heat (measured as Degree Heating Weeks, DHW) affects loss of

423

cover differentially among taxa we used a linear mixed effects model. The fixed effect was

424

DHW, and we allowed for a random effect of taxonomic grouping on both the intercept and

425

slope of the relationship between coral cover change and DHW. Coral cover change was

426

measured as log(final % cover + 0.0002) minus log(initial % cover+0.0002) (0.0002 was the

427

smallest observed value in the data set). Also, we excluded from the analysis observations

428

with zero initial coral cover of a particular taxonomic group. This treatment of the data

429

yielded the best agreement between the residuals and the model’s statistical assumptions. The

24
430

estimated random effect on intercepts was approximately zero, so we eliminated it from our

431

final model. Thus, in the final model, there was a common intercept, but differences between

432

taxa in sensitivity to DHW (i.e., there was a random effect of taxonomic group on the slope).

433

To illustrate these differences, Extended data Fig. 5 plots the estimated slope of coral cover

434

change for each taxon versus DHW as the overall mean effect of DHW plus the taxon-

435

specific random effect. Conditional standard errors plotted in Extended data Fig. 5 are the

436

standard errors on each random effect.

437

Shifts in functional traits

438

To calculate how differential mortality affected the mix of traits in the coral assemblages, we

439

scored eight traits for 12 of the 15 functional groupings (excluding Soft Corals, Other

440

Scleractinia, and Other Sessile Fauna, Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). We chose traits that

441

are likely to influence ecosystem functions. For example, corals with fast growth rates and

442

high skeletal density strongly influence calcification, colony shape affects photosynthesis and

443

the provision of three-dimensional habitat, and the size of corallites is a measure of

444

heterotrophy. The traits were scored using the Coral Trait Database27 , with the exception of

445

colony size which we measured directly for each group on reef crests using the geometric

446

mean of intercept lengths for each taxon from our initial transects. For multi-species groups,

447

the traits were generally identical for all species. Otherwise, for Montipora and Porites, we

448

used the mean score across the reef crest species we encountered. To measure the depletion

449

of traits based on changes in absolute abundances between March and November (Fig. 3e-f),

450

we used a community weighted mean (CWM) analysis of each trait:

451
452

𝑛𝑛

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = � 𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖=1

25
453

where ai is the abundance of coral taxa i and traiti is the trait value of coral taxa i. This metric

454

provides a trait value for each reef weighted by the total abundance of each taxa. To visualise

455

the overall shift in functional composition, we used a non-metric multi-dimensional scaling

456

analysis (nMDS) based on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix of square-root transformed data for

457

each trait community weighted mean, creating a multi-dimensional trait space in which reefs

458

are positioned according to the value and abundance of critical traits.
