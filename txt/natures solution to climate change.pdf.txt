hen it comes to saving the planet, one
whale is worth thousands of trees.
Scientific research now indicates more
clearly than ever that our carbon footprint—the
release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere,
where it contributes to global warming through the
so-called greenhouse effect—now threatens our
ecosystems and our way of life. But efforts to mitigate
climate change face two significant challenges. The
first is to find effective ways to reduce the amount
of CO2 in the atmosphere or its impact on average
global temperature. The second is to raise sufficient
funds to put these technologies into practice.
Many proposed solutions to global warming,
such as capturing carbon directly from the air

and burying it deep in the earth, are complex,
untested, and expensive. What if there were a
low-tech solution to this problem that not only was
effective and economical, but also had a successful
funding model?
An example of such an opportunity comes from
a surprisingly simple and essentially “no-tech”
strategy to capture more carbon from the atmosphere: increase global whale populations. Marine
biologists have recently discovered that whales—
especially the great whales—play a significant role
in capturing carbon from the atmosphere (Roman
and others 2014). And international organizations
have implemented programs such as Reducing
Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation

(REDD) that fund the preservation of carboncapturing ecosystems.
Adapting these initiatives to support international
efforts to restore whale populations could lead to a
breakthrough in the fight against climate change.
The carbon capture potential of whales is truly
startling. Whales accumulate carbon in their bodies
during their long lives. When they die, they sink to
the bottom of the ocean; each great whale sequesters
33 tons of CO2 on average, taking that carbon out
of the atmosphere for centuries. A tree, meanwhile,
absorbs only up to 48 pounds of CO2 a year.
Protecting whales could add significantly to carbon
capture because the current population of the largest
great whales is only a small fraction of what it once
was. Sadly, after decades of industrialized whaling,
biologists estimate that overall whale populations are
now less than one-fourth what they once were. Some
species, like the blue whales, have been reduced to
only 3 percent of their previous abundance. Thus,

the benefits from whales’ ecosystem services to us
and to our survival are much less than they could be.
But this is only the beginning of the story.

The whale pump
Wherever whales, the largest living things on
earth, are found, so are populations of some of the
smallest, phytoplankton. Not only do these microscopic creatures contribute at least 50 percent
of all oxygen to our atmosphere, they do so by
capturing about 37 billion metric tons of CO2,
an estimated 40 percent of all CO2 produced. To
put things in perspective, we calculate that this is
equivalent to the amount of CO2 captured by 1.70
trillion trees—four Amazon forests’ worth—or 70
times the amount absorbed by all the trees in the
US Redwood National and State Parks each year.
More phytoplankton means more carbon capture.
In recent years, scientists have discovered that
whales have a multiplier effect of increasing

phytoplankton production wherever they go.
How? It turns out that whales’ waste products
contain exactly the substances—notably iron and
nitrogen—phytoplankton need to grow. Whales
bring minerals up to the ocean surface through their
vertical movement, called the “whale pump,” and
through their migration across oceans, called the
“whale conveyor belt” (see Chart 1). Preliminary
modeling and estimates indicate that this fertilizing
activity adds significantly to phytoplankton growth
in the areas whales frequent.
Despite the fact that nutrients are carried into
the ocean through dust storms, river sediments,
and upwelling from wind and waves, nitrogen and
phosphorus remain scarce and limit the amount of
phytoplankton that can bloom in warmer parts of
the oceans. In colder regions, such as in the Southern
Ocean, the limiting mineral tends to be iron. If
more of these missing minerals became available
in parts of the ocean where they are scarce, more
phytoplankton could grow, potentially absorbing
much more carbon than otherwise possible.

Letting whales live
This is where the whales come in. If whales were
allowed to return to their prewhaling number of 4
to 5 million—from slightly more than 1.3 million
today—it could add significantly to the amount
of phytoplankton in the oceans and to the carbon
they capture each year. At a minimum, even a 1
percent increase in phytoplankton productivity
thanks to whale activity would capture hundreds of
millions of tons of additional CO2 a year, equivalent
to the sudden appearance of 2 billion mature trees.
Imagine the impact over the average lifespan of a
whale, more than 60 years.
Despite the drastic reduction in commercial
whaling, whales still face significant life-threatening
hazards, including ship strikes, entanglement in
fishing nets, waterborne plastic waste, and noise
pollution. While some species of whales are recovering—slowly—many are not.
Enhancing protection of whales from humanmade dangers would deliver benefits to humans,
the planet, and of course, the whales themselves.
This “earth-tech” approach to carbon sequestration
also avoids the risk of unanticipated harm from
suggested untested high-tech fixes. Nature has
had millions of years to perfect her whale-based
carbon sink technology. All we need to do is let
the whales live.

Now we turn to the economic side of the solution. Protecting whales has a cost. Mitigating the
many threats to whales involves compensating
those causing the threats, a group that includes
countries, businesses, and individuals. Ensuring
that this approach is practical involves determining
whales’ monetary value.

International public good
Whales produce climate benefits that are dispersed
all over the globe. And because people’s benefits from
the existence of whales do not diminish the benefits
that others receive from them, they are a textbook
public good (see Chart 2). This means that whales are
affected by the classic “tragedy of the commons” that
afflicts public goods: no individual who benefits from
them is sufficiently motivated to pay his or her fair
share to support them. Just think of the importance
of earth’s atmosphere to humans’ survival. Even
though all nations acknowledge that everyone has
an interest in preserving this common resource for
the future, global coordination remains a problem.
To solve this international public goods problem,
we must first ask, What is the monetary value of a
whale? Proper valuation is warranted if businesses
and other stakeholders are to be galvanized to save
the whales by showing that the benefits of protecting
them far exceed the cost. We estimate the value of an
average great whale by determining today’s value of
the carbon sequestered by a whale over its lifetime,
using scientific estimates of the amount whales
contribute to carbon sequestration, the market price
of carbon dioxide, and the financial technique of
discounting. To this, we also add today’s value of the
whale’s other economic contributions, such as fishery
enhancement and ecotourism, over its lifetime. Our
conservative estimates put the value of the average
great whale, based on its various activities, at more
than $2 million, and easily over $1 trillion for the
current stock of great whales.
But there is still the question of how to reduce
the myriad dangers to whales, such as ship strikes
and other hazards. Luckily, economists know how
these types of problems can be solved. In fact, a
potential model for such solutions is the United
Nations (UN) REDD program. Recognizing that
deforestation accounts for 17 percent of carbon
emissions, REDD provides incentives for countries
to preserve their forests as a means of keeping CO2
out of the atmosphere. In a similar way, we can create
financial mechanisms to promote the restoration

of the world’s whale populations. Incentives in the
form of subsidies or other compensation could help
those who incur significant costs as a result of whale
protection. For example, shipping companies could
be compensated for the cost of altered shipping
routes to reduce the risk of collisions.
This solution, however, raises questions that are
tricky to answer. To begin with, a financial facility
for protecting whales and other natural assets must
be set up and funded. Exactly how much should we
be willing to spend on protecting the whales? We
estimate that, if whales were allowed to return to
their prewhaling numbers—capturing 1.7 billion
tons of CO2 annually—it would be worth about
$13 a person a year to subsidize these whales’ CO2
sequestration efforts. If we agree to pay this cost, how
should it be allocated across countries, individuals,
and businesses? How much should each individual,
company, and country that must bear some of the
cost of protecting whales be compensated? And
who will oversee the compensation and monitor
compliance with the new rules?
International financial institutions, in partnership with other UN and multilateral
organizations, are ideally suited to advise, monitor,
and coordinate the actions of countries in protecting

whales. Whales are commonly found in the waters
around low-income and fragile states, countries that
may be unable to deal with the needed mitigation
measures. Support for these countries could come,
for example, from the Global Environment Facility,
which typically provides support to such countries to
meet international environmental agreements. The
IMF is also well placed to help governments integrate
the macroeconomic benefit that whales provide in
mitigating climate change, as well as the cost of
measures to protect the whales, into their macro-fiscal
frameworks. The World Bank has the expertise to
design and implement specific programs to compensate private sector actors for their efforts to protect
whales. Other UN and multilateral organizations
can oversee compliance and collect data to measure
the progress of these efforts.

A new mindset
Coordinating the economics of whale protection
must rise to the top of the global community’s climate
agenda. Since the role of whales is irreplaceable in
mitigating and building resilience to climate change,
their survival should be integrated into the objectives
of the 190 countries that in 2015 signed the Paris
Agreement for combating climate risk.

International institutions and governments,
however, must also exert their influence to bring
about a new mindset—an approach that recognizes
and implements a holistic approach toward human
survival, which involves living within the bounds
of the natural world. Whales are not a human
solution—these great creatures having inherent
value of their own and the right to live—but this
new mindset recognizes and values their integral
place in a sustainable ocean and planet. Healthy
whale populations imply healthy marine life including fish, seabirds, and an overall vibrant system
that recycles nutrients between oceans and land,
improving life in both places. The “earth-tech”
strategy of supporting whales’ return to their previous abundance in the oceans would significantly
benefit not only life in the oceans, but also life on
land, including our own.
With the consequences of climate change here
and now, there is no time to lose in identifying
and implementing new methods to prevent or
reverse harm to the global ecosystem. This is
especially true when it comes to improving the
protection of whales so that their populations can
grow more quickly. Unless new steps are taken,
we estimate it would take over 30 years just to
