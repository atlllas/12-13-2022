Summary
Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely
adopted as the leading tool for coral-reef conservation, but resource users seldom accept them [1, 2],
and many have failed to produce tangible conservation benefits [3]. Few studies have objectively and
simultaneously examined the types of MPAs that are
most effective in conserving reef resources and
the socioeconomic factors responsible for effective
conservation [4–6]. We simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves,
and three traditionally managed areas in Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea. Underwater visual censuses
of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed that the
average size and biomass of fishes were higher in
all areas under traditional management and at one
comanaged reserve when compared to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10]
revealed that this ‘‘effective conservation’’ was positively related to compliance, visibility of the reserve,
and length of time the management had been in place
but negatively related to market integration, wealth,
and village population size. We suggest that in cases
where the resources for enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent conservation success than regimes designed
primarily for biodiversity conservation.
Results and Discussion
From an ecological perspective, effective coral-reef
conservation can be viewed as increasing or maintaining key ecosystem parameters such as fish biomass
or coral cover, maintaining ecosystem processes and
function, or increasingly, promoting resilience to disturbances and fluctuations [11]. Due to the synchronic
nature of our comparative study, we adopted an easily

measurable and commonly used definition of effective
conservation—namely, that effective management
would cause utilized resources or key ecological indicators to be higher inside compared to outside managed
areas [12, 13]. This measure can be potentially weaker
than those derived from comparisons of resources before and after closure [14], but it has been used because
it requires significantly less time and fewer research expenses. This measure was also found to produce comparable results in the intensively studied management
systems of the Philippines [15]. We studied the effectiveness of three broad types of management: national
parks, comanaged areas, and traditionally managed
areas. National parks were large areas (6,600–111,625
ha), managed and enforced by the national government
with the explicit goals of sustainable use and improving
the condition of reef resources. Comanaged reserves
were small areas (11.8–60 ha), managed and enforced
by the community in partnership with nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), tourism operators, and universities for a variety of social and ecological goals, such
as improving resources and providing income through
tourism revenue. The traditionally managed areas we
examined were small (33.2–58 ha), periodic reef closures
or gear-restricted areas that were instigated and maintained by the community for the explicit goals of providing food for celebratory feasts, reinforcing of intercommunity relations, or mitigating conflicts, and in one
case, ‘‘taming’’ the fish to make them easier to spear [16].
The effectiveness of management in conserving reef
resources was examined with underwater visual censuses of key resources and ecological parameters at
replicate study sites located inside and outside managed areas. Unmanaged control sites were carefully
selected to be as similar to managed sites as possible
in environmental and physical characteristics such as
reef geomorphology, level of exposure to wave action,
and current regimes, so that the only expected major difference between management and control sites was the
presence or absence of a management system.
Only two ecosystem variables, average size and biomass of targeted fish species, were commonly found
to be different inside versus outside managed areas
(Table 1). The most provocative finding was that three
of the four sites that had a greater average size and biomass of fishes within the managed areas were the selfgoverning, traditional management regimes (Figure 1).
Contrary to the widely accepted idea that permanent
closures are the most effective ways to improve reef
ecosystem health [17], none of the traditional management regimes involved permanent reef closures. Each
involved periodic closures, whereby protected reefs
were periodically opened to fishing, either briefly or for
extended periods of time, and one of these systems
actually allowed line fishing inside the protected area
throughout the entire year. Interestingly, the traditional
management systems were implemented to meet utilitarian community goals, such as providing food for

celebratory feasts, rather than to fulfil western ecological concepts of conservation [18]. Despite the periodic
nature of these protected areas, the absence of external
funding, and the explicit goals of resource utilization,
traditional management systems still appeared to provide significant conservation benefits for reef fish
stocks. The fourth site to display strong differences
in fish biomass and size structure was a comanaged,
protected area with a permanent reef closure (Table 1).
This MPA was designed largely from a social perspective after intensive social surveys and community

Large positive percentages suggest a highly effective conservation
result. Confidence intervals were calculated from means of replicate

Site means were calculated from four to six transects within each

consultation. Key informants noted that the reserve
location was chosen specifically because it was visible
to the community. The community received significant
external assistance to establish and maintain the management regime in the form of funding, awareness and
education programs, and community support programs. One national park site displayed significantly
greater hard coral cover within the protected area compared to surrounding reefs; however, this difference was
marginal (Table 1), and the site did not show a response
to management in other ecosystem variables.
The majority of the other ecosystem variables, such as
coral and fish diversity, coral cover, and the overall
abundance of targeted fishes, showed little difference
in magnitude inside versus outside protected areas at
any of the management sites. The explanation for the
lack of significant difference in other ecological variables was likely to be (1) that management was largely
ineffective in conserving coral reefs in all of the cases examined, (2) sampling was not powerful enough to detect
differences in most ecological variables, (3) local fishing
pressure was too light for management to have significant effects on reef resources, or (4) most parameters
did not respond as strongly to management as expected. Although sampling precision was low in a few
instances, variables were sampled intensively at each
site, and relatively good precision was achieved for
most variables (Table 1). Parameters that would be expected to respond the most strongly to effective management were those that were most directly affected
by resource users, and hence, alleviated when protected by management. At almost all sites, reef fishes
were the most commonly targeted resource. The parameters that were expected to most directly and precisely
describe the changing condition of fished stocks, population-size structure [19] and, in relation, the biomass
of fish stocks showed the greatest difference between
managed and unmanaged areas under some of the
management regimes. This would suggest that the

fourth explanation is likely, and only those parameters
that documented changes in the most heavily targeted
resources were effective indicators of management success. The densities of targeted reef fishes were also expected to provide a reliable indication of the effect of
management. However, target fish densities were highly
variable among sites, and good precision was difficult to
achieve. Other studies suggest that the density of reef
fishes may respond to fishing pressure in an unpredictable manner as a result of phenomena such as prey release and reduced competition among smaller individuals when large individuals are removed by fishing
[20]. By comparison, the size structure of targeted fish
populations, and in relation, the biomass of fishery
stocks, were less variable among sites than fish density
alone and appeared to provide the most precise indication of management effects.
Because few of the ecological indicators showed differences inside versus outside managed areas, we used
the most responsive of our ecological indicators to define whether a study site had ‘‘effective conservation’’
for the purposes of our socioeconomic analysis. We categorized sites as having effective conservation if they
had a significantly greater biomass or average size of
targeted fish inside versus outside managed areas.
Coral cover responded to management at only one of
the sites examined; this response was fairly weak, and
the management site did not show differences in any
other ecological variables. Therefore, coral cover was

not deemed an appropriate indicator of effective management in this study’s analyses.
The effectiveness of management regimes in conserving reef resources depends not only on whether the
dynamics of the conservation strategy can complement
the local ecology, but also on whether resource users
adhere to the associated rules and regulations of the
regimes. Despite lowering benefits for the entire user
group, an individual’s rational self-interest can be to
overutilize collectively owned resources, because the
short-term benefit of such action is almost entirely
acquired by the individual, whereas the burden is shared
with the entire group of users [21]. However, this opportunistic behavior is not inevitable in common-property
resource scenarios, and decisions to act in collective
rather than individual interest can be influenced by
social and economic factors [22, 23].
We used a combination of household surveys, keyinformant interviews, and participant observation to examine the socioeconomic conditions in communities
within and adjacent to the managed areas [6, 9, 10].
The socioeconomic conditions in our study sites varied
widely, from the peri-urban Pulau Seribu, with high populations and market connectivity (indicated by a high
proportion of fish sold and engagement in salaried
employment), to remote sites such as Kakarotan, with
low populations and primarily subsistence fisheries
(Table 2). We examined whether socioeconomic factors
were related to the outcomes of reef-management

The socioeconomic characteristics of communities with ‘‘effective’’

and the Fisher’s Exact test for dichotomous indicators. ns = nonsignificant (p > 0.1); +ve = significantly higher in communities with effective conservation (p < 0.1); 2ve = significantly higher in communities

strategies by testing whether communities with effective
fishery conservation had differed from communities
without effective conservation in 21 socioeconomic
characteristics. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to
determine whether significant differences existed, and
we also used effect size (d) to examine the strength of
relationships. This provided us with a gradient of relationships; communities with statistically significant differences and high effect sizes, communities with considerable effect sizes but no significant differences
(indicating that relationships may exist but our power
may have been too low to detect differences), and communities with low effect sizes and nonsignificant differences (Table 3).
We found that sites that were effective at conserving
resources had significantly higher observed compliance
(measured as the amount of discarded fishing gear recorded inside the closure compared to the control sites),
were visible to the community, and had been closed longer than ineffective areas (Table 3). These communities
also had significantly less market influences (i.e., proportion of fish sold or bartered and involvement in formal
economic activities such as teaching, government employment, and other salaried positions), lower population sizes, and less wealth (i.e., fortnightly expenditures).

We were willing to accept significance values of p < 0.1
as statistically significant for two indicators (percentage
of fish sold to markets and time of closure of managed
areas) because of the exploratory nature of the study
and the high effect sizes of these indicators. High-cost
activities that are typically the focus of conservation
programs, such as fostering awareness of the management rules and maintaining active enforcement patrols,
were not found to be significantly related to effective
management, although awareness had a considerable
effect size.
Several other factors that demonstrated substantial
effect sizes (d > 0.8 or < 20.8 [24]) but were not statistically significant (p R 0.1) included total number and
percentage of households engaged in fishing, occupational multiplicity, and the proportion of immigrants in
communities. These high effect sizes indicate that substantial relationships may exist between these factors
and the outcomes of marine conservation initiatives,
but with our relatively limited sample size, we could
not detect statistically significant differences. Factors
such as active involvement in decision making, involvement in community groups, the mean years of formal
education, and the proportion of the community involved in alternative occupations such as tourism and
farming did not demonstrate substantial effect sizes or
statistically significant differences, suggesting that their
relationship to the outcomes of reef management was
weak.
All effective sites were able to exclude ‘‘outsiders’’ at
a relatively low cost because of placement of the managed areas were near the village. In addition, the effective traditional sites had strong customary marine tenure
institutions, which prohibited nonowners from accessing reef resources [6, 9, 16]. Interestingly, observed
compliance was highest in the three self-governing traditionally managed areas, which did not have regular enforcement patrols, suggesting that the effectiveness of
these sites in conserving reef resources was because
of intrinsic motivations to act collectively and comply
with regulations [25, 26]. Our in-depth case studies of
these traditionally managed sites [9, 16] found that
social influences promoting collective action and the
perceived justness and legitimacy of regulations [27]
may have been particularly high in traditional management institutions because they reflected local understandings of human-environment interactions, were an
integral part of local cultures and traditions, and provided the communities with tangible benefits. For example, communities periodically fished these areas and
perceived direct benefits of the management system;
thus, these systems met more individual and community
goals than systems of permanent closure. In addition,
most members of the community were regularly reminded of the closures through participation in the
traditions and feasts [28]. High compliance in the
effective comanagement site in Indonesia may have
stemmed from the significant input of external resources to this community; similar factors were found
to be responsible for effective management at sites in
the Philippines [4].
In all traditionally managed sites, village leaders had
some control over when and how much harvesting
occurred within the protected area. Leaders also had

Current Biology

the autonomy not only to develop rules that were congruent to local ecological and social conditions but
also to adapt management to observed changes in
ecosystem dynamics, socioeconomic influences, and
evasion of governance rules [29–31]. For example, in
Muluk, clan leaders instituted a temporary closure
when they observed a decrease in fish abundance [31].
The size of the closure, length of time, and sanctions
for violations could vary to meet the changing needs of
the village and ecosystem.
The ability of periodic closures to improve fish stocks
is likely to depend upon the intensity of the harvesting
when the areas are opened to fishing as well as the life
histories of the targeted species. In the case of one of
these sites, Ahus, periodic harvesting was found to be
relatively benign in its effects on the overall standing
stocks of reef fishes, with harvests being carried out
on only one day every 6–12 months and removing only
around 5% of the available biomass on each occasion
[16]. However, if similar management methods were to
be employed elsewhere, especially in areas of intense
fishing pressure, the extent and type of harvesting to
occur in managed areas would have to be carefully
monitored and regulated, because differences in fishing
effort, gears used, and frequency of harvests could
influence the outcomes and management benefits. Although meta-analysis studies of MPAs suggest that recovery of some target species can occur within the first
few years of area closure [12], some species may require
recovery periods of longer than two decades, particularly when fishing is intense around boundaries [14, 15,
32]. Consequently, although the use of small, limitedharvest areas under certain conditions may bring direct
benefits to reef ecosystems and fishing communities by
allowing a buildup in fish biomass, there is still likely to
be a need for larger, permanently closed areas for species that require long periods without disturbance [33]
or large areas within which the fish can safely move
and not be regularly caught.
In conclusion, this study suggests that the consideration of local socioeconomic factors and development
of locally appropriate adaptive regulations are essential
if we are to improve the ability of coral-reef management
regimes to conserve resources. Coral-reef conservation
based on large MPAs with weak enforcement may be
ill-suited to the social, economic, and cultural context
of many communities within the center of coral diversity,
and insistence on these conservation methods may
lead to polarization between national-government regulators and local communities [1, 2]. In situations where
the resources for proper enforcement are lacking, alternative management regimes that are better able to
meet a range of community goals may achieve greater
acceptance, compliance, and subsequent conservation
success than systems designed primarily for national
interests of tourism and biodiversity conservation. Although large, permanent MPAs may provide the best
protection for species that are highly susceptible to
overfishing, a combination of MPAs and alternative
systems of management, such as traditional systems,
may provide the best overall solution for meeting
conservation and community goals and reversing the
degradation of reef ecosystems within the center of
coral diversity.
