Spatialized catch and effort data, representing the world’s marine ﬁsheries in the 1950s and the 2000s
are presented in form of cartograms, i.e., global maps in which the surface areas of continents are made
proportional to the magnitude of the annual catches and ﬁshing effort by their ﬂeets. This is
complemented by an analysis of the ﬂows of seafood between the continents in whose waters the
ﬁsh were captured, in the 1950s and the 2000s, and the continents where ﬂeets originated. Such broadbrush analyses of temporal changes and trade patterns are helpful to understand major trends of
ﬁsheries, which, are increasingly dominated by scarcity of ﬁsh, and competition, notably off the coast of
West Africa, and in newly accessed polar waters.

1. Introduction
Modern humans have exploited marine resources since we
emerged as a species (see, e.g., [1]). When harsh conditions
threatened the small population of early humans, coastal marine
resources allowed them to survive [2]. But since then, human
have thrived, and have strongly impacted marine, and particularly
coastal species and ecosystems [3], especially in the last 150
years, which saw the industrialization of ﬁsheries [4]. Notably,
global ﬁshing patterns have strongly changed since the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published its ﬁrst
collection of global ﬁsheries landings in the mid 1950s [5]. Fishing
ﬂeets have been challenged by stock collapses [6], while empowered
by improved technologies and logistic support. Many ﬁsheries are
now multinational enterprises (see, e.g., [7,8]). Since the adoption, in
the late 1970s/early 1980s of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) by
maritime countries [9], the roving ﬂeets of distant-water countries
have had to negotiate coastal zone access arrangements. Though
maps of where ﬁshing occurs have always accompanied this activity,
these documents were seen as commercially valuable, and were not
willingly disclosed, as ﬁshing is, of course, a very competitive
business. Trying to see the big picture has therefore been extremely
difﬁcult, while increasingly necessary to examine potential impacts
on marine ecosystems, and those commercial and non-commercial
plants and animals embedded in them. Additionally, the impacts of
climate change will challenge our ability to plan and mitigate [10].
The Sea Around Us project, which began in 1999 ([11,12]), has
used publicly available ﬁsheries landing statistics, to map where

global landings were taken on a ﬁne-scale [13,14]. Subsequently,
this same project mapped global ﬁshing effort as well [15–17].
These mapped databases allow ﬁshing activity to be associated on a
spatial scale of use to policy makers and ecologists alike, especially
when the data they presented were reﬁned to allow a breakdown by
ﬁshing country and associated ﬁshing gear. Such data breakdowns
allowed for comparison with oceanographic and satellite data such
as primary productivity [18–20], as one of the most potent measures
of ﬁshing intensity is how much of local primary production is
appropriated in form of ﬁsheries catches. Mapping global ﬁsheries
catches has also been valuable in detecting irregularities, such as
hidden or inﬂated catch reporting, as was the case for China [21].
Studying and understanding the trajectory of changes in the marine
environment induced by anthropocentric activities, and particularly
ﬁshing, is important to formulating marine policy. Here changes that
have occurred since global catch statistics began to be published
annually in the 1950s are explored.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Global catch and effort data
The ﬁshing landing data were sourced from the Sea Around Us
project [12,13], as compiled from a range of sources including the
FAO ﬁsheries database, supplemented by regional datasets, and
augmented in a few cases, with reconstructed datasets, e.g., from
[22]. It is quality-checked, and mapped to a system of 300 by 300
spatial cells using a rule-based approach based on original spatial
information, the access of ﬂeets to coastal waters (through reports
or explicit access agreements), and the distribution of the
reported ﬁsh marine taxa, as inferred from geography and

[24] for invertebrates [25].
Fishing effort data was sourced from the Sea Around Us project
[17]. This data was standardized and collated, based on engine
power (Watts) and ﬁshing days [16] from a range of public domain
sources including the FAO’s Coordinated Working Party on Fisheries
Statistics (FAO-CWS), and European Union Common Fishing Policy
Statistics (EU) for non-tuna ﬁshing, the Secretariat of the Paciﬁc
Community (SPC), International Commission for the Conservation of
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
(IATTC), Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and FAO’s Atlas of
Tuna and Billﬁsh for tuna ﬁshing (FAO-Atlas), and the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
for ﬁshing effort in the Antarctic region. The resultant harmonized
global dataset was mapped to 300 by 300 spatial cells using a variety
of processes, depending on spatial information present in the
original sources. The data from SCP, ICCAT, IATTC, IOTC, FAO-Atlas,
and the CCAMLR data provided spatial information, whereas, the
FAO-CWS and EU statistics did not, and thus required further spatial
modelling. Fishing effort was ﬁrst apportioned to ﬂeet-accessible
ports, then mapped to spatial cells in adjacent waters using a twoscale gravity-model, based on the value of mapped landings taken
from surrounding waters based on modelled landings from the Sea
Around Us project’s databases.

2.2. Cartogram
Global ﬁsheries (landings and effort) data by continents were
used to produce cartograms, i.e., maps where the land area of
each continent was made proportional to some interesting
quantity (here: catch weight and ﬁshing effort). For this, ESRI’s
ArcMap 10 Cartogram Geoprocessing Tool Ver 2 [26] was used.

The global distributions of ﬁsheries landings in the 1950s and
early to mid-2000s are shown in Fig. 1.
Here, the area of continents is distorted by the share their
ﬂeets take of the global total. As can be seen in the 1950s, Europe
and Asia dominated ﬁsheries landings, while South America,
Africa, and Oceania had relatively small catches. By the 2000s,
massive changes have occurred: Europe’s share had considerably
shrunk, Asia was more dominant; and South America, and the
ﬁsheries for Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) on its west
coast, produced a large share of global landings. North America’s
share had dwindled, while Oceania’s share had remained more or
less constant.
On a per capita basis, the increases in landings between the
1950s and the 2000s in South America and in Oceania were more
evident (Table 1).
Per capita increases in Europe and North America had not kept
pace with those elsewhere, and this is the reason why they have
become, with Japan, major importers of seafood [27].
As the catches from the world’s oceans are ultimately related
to solar-supported primary productivity in marine ecosystems
[20,28,29] it is decidedly ﬁnite, and overall, global catches show
signs of diminishing [21]. The highly mobile nature of global
ﬂeets, and competition for the rights to access the comparatively
richer inshore areas now protected by exclusive economic zone
declarations, has meant, that ﬂeets dynamically compete on a
global basis for their share of ocean production. Perverse subsidies can exacerbate matters by maintaining ﬁsheries even when
they are no longer proﬁtable [30,31]. Many areas of the world’s
oceans are now fully exploited [17,20]. Foreign ﬂeets are forced to
move on once landings diminish.
It is worth examining how the ﬂow of ocean production,
manifested by ﬁsheries landings, has changed since the 1950s.
Table 2 shows the percent ﬂow from each ocean basin to the ﬂeets
based in global continents. Here, one can see that in the 1950s,
the powerhouse of ﬁsheries were the European ﬂeets in the
northern Atlantic, and the East Asian ﬂeets in the Paciﬁc, which
jointly accounted from nearly 2/3 of the ﬂow of ﬁsheries landings.
By the 2000s, landings were now more than three times
annually what they were in the 1950s. By then, however, Europe’s
share of global ﬁsheries production had halved, with a substantial
portion now taken from the Indian Ocean by Asian ﬂeets, and
from the Paciﬁc, by ﬂeets from South America. Fleets from Asia,
and China in particular, are now active in coastal African waters
[32], while European ﬂeets have also had to derive more and more

of their landings from the Atlantic areas bordering Africa [33].
Overall, the share of production taken from the Atlantic has been
reduced, while that from the Paciﬁc has increased. Distant-water
ﬁshing ﬂeets now operate in more and more remote locations,
notably in the southern hemisphere [17,19], all the way to the
slope and shelf of the Antarctic continent [34].
3.2. Fishing effort
The global change in ﬁshing effort is somewhat similar to that
of ﬁsheries landings, but there are important differences (Fig. 2).
As with ﬁshery landings, the dominant ﬂeets (based on the
average deployment of vessel power) in the 1950s, originated
from Europe and Asia. Since then, there has been an extraordinary
increase in the relative power of the ﬂeets from Asia. Though all
ﬁsheries ﬂeets have expanded during this time, it is the huge
increase in the larger vessels, especially purse seiners, pursuing
oceanic tunas that have been most dramatic [17].
Looked at on a per capita basis, the capacity of the ﬂeets from
all continents has increased (Table 1), with most ﬂeets increasing
by 2–3 times since the 1950s. This is indicative of the highly
competitive nature of global ﬁsheries, and because ﬁshing now
occurs in increasingly remote locations, requiring greater processing on board, and greater vessel endurance. The deployment of
large and high platforms of modern tuna purse seiners, augmented by helicopters, and the latest satellite data, has become more
common. Some of the increase in the power of European ﬂeets
would undoubtedly have derived from the subsidized construction of huge trawlers, which could not be accommodated in the
European waters, and now ﬁsh elsewhere.
Fisheries have, overall, moved southward since the 1950s [17,19],
and the shelf and the slopes around the Antarctic continent have
been reached [34], there in great interest in developing ﬁsheries in
the thawing Arctic [35]. In addition, continuing an age-old tradition,
ﬂeets from Europe, and now Asia, especially China, have become

more and more active along the African coast [17,32,33] which can
pose equity questions [36,37]. Recently, there was much controversy
in southern Australia, after a 142-meter long, originally-Dutch,
‘supertrawler’ was invited (and then un-invited), after years of
negotiation, to exploit Greenback horse mackerel (Trachurus declivis)
and other pelagic ﬁshes, which, due to a range of factors, including
reportedly a change in distribution through ocean warming, were no
longer viable for local ﬂeets to target. Around the world, similar
marine resources, deemed to be ‘under-harvested’, will receive more
and more scrutiny by roaming global ﬂeets. One common understanding related to the declaration of exclusive economic zones in
marine areas, is that resources that are not harvested by national
ﬂeets in these areas, should be made available for harvest by foreign
ﬂeets. For all ﬁsheries management agencies, this is a time for
increased vigilance. They must not simply focus on issues relating
to their own resources, but track carefully those of their region, and
indeed those of a global nature. Changes wrought through climate
change will alter the level and distribution of ocean catch potential
[38]. More than ever, it is necessary to look at changes in the big
picture, and act on the policy implications of their major trends.
