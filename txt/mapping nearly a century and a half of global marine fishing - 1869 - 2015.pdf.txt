Understanding global ﬁsheries patterns contributes signiﬁcantly to their management. By combining harmonized unmapped data sources with maps from satellite tracking data, regional tuna management organisations,
the ranges of ﬁshed taxa, the access of ﬂeets and the logistics of associated ﬁshing gears the expansion and
intensiﬁcation of marine ﬁsheries for nearly a century and half (1869–2015) is illustrated. Estimates of industrial, non-industrial reported, illegal/unreported (IUU) and discards reveal changes in country dominance,
catch composition and ﬁshing gear use. Catch of industrial and non-industrial marine ﬁshing by year, ﬁshing
country, taxa and gear by 30-min spatial cell broken to reported, IUU and discards is available. Results show a
historical increase in bottom trawl with corresponding reduction in the landings from seines. Though diverse,
global landings are now dominated by demersal and small pelagic species.

1. Introduction
Commercial or industrial ﬁshing arguably started before recorded
history when the immediate needs of ﬁshers were sated allowing their
excess catch to be traded for beneﬁts before it perished. Now a widely
traded global commodity [1], seafood is vital to world food security and
prosperity, with expectations that its importance will only continue to
grow with human population and climate challenges. Individual populations of harvested species can come under pressure and accessing
their status and applying suﬃcient management control is challenging
and often controversial [2]. More broadly though, in natural marine
systems, there are many limitations to seafood production including the
solar-powered primary productivity of supporting ecosystems [3,4] and
the need to maintain the irreplaceable biodiversity of these systems.
The range of global industrial ﬂeets has expanded to encompass most
areas of the world's oceans [5,6]. When has the need to get up-to-date
strategic overviews of global ﬁshing operations ever been more
pressing?
Several attempts at mapping broad global ﬁshing patterns [7,8]
have demonstrated how this information can inform ﬁsheries management as well as marine conservation. Past eﬀorts have concentrated
on enhancements to foundation data sources such as the United Nation's
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [9] which countries have
contributed to since 1950. In recent years, however, a wider range of
Supporting data sources have become available which includes specialist regional management organisations (rFMO) such as for tuna
ﬁsheries, and exciting improvements in the tracking of ﬁshing vessels
⁎

from satellites [10]. Harmonization of data from all possible sources
can only improve data quality, and for mapping, it's possible spatial
precision.
Although mapped catch is now available for periods after 1950
[7,8] this means that important ﬁshing patterns prior to the 2nd world
war are usually ignored. Here available data from 1869 is used in
combination with a new and extended compilation of novel data
sources including the latest satellite data such as the widely used Automatic [vessel] Identiﬁcation Systems (AIS) [10] to map and visualize
global ﬁshing patterns. The scale and patterns of change for the last
century and a half are revealed through a new dataset, which not only
separates industrial ﬁshing from other ﬁshing, but documents by ﬁshing
country and associated ﬁshing gear, the entire catch including estimates
of illegal, unreported and discarded catch.

Input data was sourced from publicly available websites (Table 1.).
All sources but the tuna regional management organization's (tuna
rFMO) data and Global Fishing Watch's (GFW) vessel Automatic Identiﬁcation System (AIS)-based data [10] were used initially in a similar
fashion to [7] and summarised below to map reported landings to
candidate 30-min spatial cells with a global grid (Supplementary

ﬁltering of reported landings initially assigned to candidate spatial cells
through the use of distributional information related to the associated
ﬁshing gear used, and where applicable, the tuna rFMO and AIS positional data (Table 1.) Subsequently this map of reported landings was
extended through estimates for reported, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catch and associated discards for both the industrial
and non-industrial sectors. The global Human Development Index
(HDI) [11] was used to assist estimation of IUU associated with nonindustrial ﬁsheries, and served as a simple available proxy for reporting
likelihood.
Only records of taxa with a marine origin were used - although some
are found in other habitats. Where possible, aquaculture production
was excluded, as were records describing shells, coral, amphibians,
reptiles, birds and mammals.

typically accepted to occur within 200 km of shore and within 50 m of
depth [14]. Division to sectors is acknowledged to be an imperfect
science without detailed and speciﬁc data such as from logbooks, surveys etc. which unfortunately are not available for a global assessment.
2.4. Estimation of IUU and associated discards
As in [7], estimates of IUU and associated discards were made for
each record of reported landings. For the industrial sector records the
current procedure was largely unchanged. The relative association of
landings with a range of ﬁshing gears was made based on the ﬁshing
country, the year of ﬁshing and the ﬁshed taxa [15]. This allowed
published data on rates of IUU and discarding to be used [16,17] to
guide estimation of the missing components so that the complete catch
could be estimated, and not simply reported landings.
For the non-industrial sector it was clear that in order to achieve the
published catch rates [14], as well as the national estimates for this
sector published as country reconstructions [8], that the unreported
component (IUU) of non-industrial ﬁshing was signiﬁcant. It was
decided that the level of non-reporting in this sector to FAO and other
parties was inﬂuenced by the national resources available for government monitoring. Therefore, the estimation of IUU for this sector was
adjusted by country HDI [11], with poorer countries having relatively a
larger portion of unreported landings. This expected association was
veriﬁed by examining the breakdowns within country reconstructions
[8] where a signiﬁcant relationship with R2 = 0.29 was found.

2.2. Initial mapping
FAO data for the period 1950–2015 was combined and coded with a
range of other input sources for reported ﬁsheries landings as described
in [7] (Table 1.). Overlapping records were removed, and only the most
spatially speciﬁc data was retained. Mapping involved using all means
to identify the most speciﬁc taxonomy of the reported landing datum
because this established both the potential range of ﬁshed spatial cells,
but also a gradient based on the rough abundance of the ﬁshed taxa
related to critical habitats, ocean depths etc. [12]. Within the statistical
area reported in source databases, usually only a subset of spatial cells
were accessible to the ﬁshing ﬂeets of the reporting country [13]. This
is because most global catch is taken within the claimed exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) waters of countries where the access of foreign
ﬁshing ﬂeets is regulated and usually documented.

2.5. Adjustment for associated ﬁshing gear logistics
It was possible to associate each ﬁshing record with a range of
ﬁshing gears using the ﬁshing year, country and the ﬁshed taxon as
described in [7,15]. Each ﬁshing gear was deemed to have a general
global pattern of probable spatial distribution largely based on distance
oﬀshore, depth of water and the distributions of target taxa as summarised from previous mapping of catch and ﬁshing eﬀort [7,18]. For
non-industrial ﬁshing, a single distribution was considered, which favoured the published association with nearshore and shallow areas
[14].
The ﬁshing gear logistics distribution was used to ﬁlter and redistribute catch associated with spatial cells in earlier processing. This
further processing did, for example, rule out sites far oﬀ shore for nonindustrial ﬁshing by proportionately increasing landings associated

2.3. Separation to industrial and non-industrial sectors
The separation of landings from industrial and non-industrial
ﬁshing was based on a number of factors. The ﬁrst was whether the taxa
had a clear association to ﬁshing gear typically not used in non-industrial ﬁshing such as with tuna purse seine operations. Additionally,
for each country the division was further derived by the relative association of the taxon described as landing by the two ﬁshing sectors
during the period of ﬁshing by published catch reconstructions [8]. In
addition, where the ﬁshing occurred was considered important to the
likely association with a ﬁshing sector. Non-industrial ﬁshing is

2.8. Mapping historical data (pre-1950)

with nearshore candidate cells. The purpose was to enforce some rational and realistic consideration of gear-based logistic cost/beneﬁt
constraints on mapped solutions which has been missing in previous
mapped database versions [7,8].

A number of data sources describe country ﬁsheries landings,
sometimes by taxa, as early as Roman times. In limited cases, reconstructions exist for some stocks such as Atlantic herring and cod for
nearly 1000 years [20]. Here the sources described in Table 1 were used
as the basis for extending mapped reported landings to 1869. The
procedure used was similar to that described for more recent (post1950) industrial ﬁsheries (above). The spatial guide used was based on
the same reporting country and ﬁshed taxon in 1950. If there was no
such matching record then the time period used was generalized to any
ﬁshing in the 1950s. If this failed then the ﬁshed taxon was generalized
to a broader taxonomic range. Using this method, it was possible to map
all available historical records.

2.6. Adjustment for tuna ﬁsheries
For tuna ﬁsheries, there exists greater mapping challenges and opportunities than for most other ﬁsheries which are largely inshore. Tuna
ﬁsheries encompass all tropical and sub-tropical seas but each year,
depending on the oceanographic conditions and any ﬁshing access
agreements negotiated by roving ﬂeets, the focus of ﬁshing can be in
vastly diﬀerent areas within the broad range of the ﬁshed taxa. Data
from FAO and other sources has always been instructive to focus catch
mapping to speciﬁc locations, as is the data made available by tuna
rFMOs (Table 1.). Annual distributions, often in 1-degree or 5-degree
spatial areas were used to improve the redistribution of spatial mapping
from initial processing for the appropriate tuna taxa and associated
ﬁshing gears.

2.9. Data structure and availability
In order to facilitate access to the data described, all the mapped
data has been made available for public download (http://dx.doi.org/
10.4226/77/5a65572655f73;
http://data.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/
search?uuid=ﬀ1274e1-c0ab-411b-a8a2-5a12eb27f2c0). The mapped
catch data consists of ASCII records in 5-year blocks with structures
described in Supplemental Material.

2.7. Adjustment using satellite data
Most recently it has been possible to track the movement of large
vessels at sea from satellites. Though there are dedicated systems such
as satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) used extensively in ﬁsheries management, these data are not widely available nor do they
cover most global ﬁshing operations. Most recently the use of AIS positional vessel tracking has shown promise. With considerable processing, it has even been possible to determine not only if the vessel is a
ﬁshing but even something about the associated ﬁshing gears used and
probable vessel size [10]. Unfortunately, the AIS coverage has only
become good in 2016 and is still weak in some areas such as SE Asia due
to many factors [19]. Where possible, however, especially for oﬀshore
ﬁshing for tuna, these data can add another valuable source of information about ﬁshing distributions. AIS data from 2016 was used to
constrain the mapping of relevant catches for 2015 and, with reducing
eﬀect, for ﬁshing years back to 2010. Before 2010 it was considered
that recent AIS data could not improve mapping procedures.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Coverage
Using the described sources and methodology it was possible to
assemble a mapped global database of reported landings of industrial
ﬁshing with estimates of their associated IUU and discards for
1869–2015 inclusive (Fig. 1A). Before 1950 reported landings were
assumed to come from industrial or commercial ﬁsheries. Before the
start of FAO's reporting in 1950 (Fig. 1. B) there were much lower levels
of reported landings and hence their associated IUU and discards were
much smaller. There was an early peak in reported ﬁshing in the
1930–40 s before the signiﬁcant reduction during the 2nd world war
clearly seen in the time series. After the war, global reports of ﬁsheries
173

and Japan (Fig. 2a). Reported landings, even when adjusted for likely
underreporting and discarding were much lower than the current intensity of ﬁshing (note units for Fig. 2a and b are in kg whereas for
Fig. 2c and d they are in tonnes).
By the early 1900s more countries were collecting national ﬁsheries
landings statistics (Fig. 2b) and ICES has a historical time series of
landings in the European seas which still continues from that time. Most
ﬁsheries were coastal in nature and the majority of ﬁshing vessels had a
limited endurance because of a range of factors including the challenges
of preserving the catch. There were exceptions such as the very long
voyages for cod which was readily accepted salted [23].
Just before and since the 2nd world war (Fig. 2c) there was a vast
expansion of global ﬁshing ﬂeets. Fishing intensiﬁed inshore but,
moreover, ﬂeets now pursued large pelagics like tuna species across
entire oceans. Fishing deeper allowed ﬁshing down the continental
slope and to distant seamounts [24,25], however, some of these deeper
stocks were not as productive as initially thought [26]. It was then
feasible to ﬁsh in polar regions but it soon became accepted that while
some species such as krill appeared to have great potential, others were
long-lived species requiring careful management. Many regional and
international management agencies began during this period as ﬂeets
travelled increasingly greater distances [6], and deals were struck for
access to the declared exclusive economic zones of 200-nautical miles
that most countries claimed. During this time many poorer countries
reduced their commercial ﬁshing [27] and allowed the access of foreign
ﬂeets but it was not always to their advantage to do so [28,29].
By 2000 (Fig. 2d), ﬁsheries had generally intensiﬁed, particularly in
the Asian region but also in many other locations. While management
in some areas limited expansion, there was little control in other places
as levels of eﬀective ﬁsheries management varied greatly [30]. The
increased use of waters along the African north-west and west coast by
initially European ﬂeets (sometimes involving reﬂagging) [27] was
compounded by ﬂeets from Asia [31]. Catches did not increase despite
the additional ﬁshing intensity and the increasing area of the oceans
ﬁshed [18,32]. A greater portion of the ﬁnite marine ecosystem primary
productivity was directed to harvested seafoods than ever before.

landings quickly returned to prewar levels with a steep and constant
rise until maximum levels of the 1980–90 s. Following this, levels have
been fallen slightly despite increasing ﬁshing eﬀort [18,21].
After 1950 It was possible to make separate estimates for the industrial and non-industrial sectors (Fig. 1C). Though of greater uncertainty, the non-industrial sector is signiﬁcant and may play a greater
role in the domestic supply of protein in some countries than catch from
industrial ﬁshing.
Putting all components of catch from both major sectors together
(Fig. 1D) their relative magnitude becomes clear. Global estimates of
marine ﬁsheries catch in recent years has not increased much after
steady increase from 1949 to the late 1980s. More than half of global
marine catch is taken by industrial ﬁsheries and now described in international reporting systems such as by the United Nation's FAO databases which collate national data from contributing countries [9].
The 2nd biggest component of global marine catch is estimated to
be that currently unreported by non-industrial ﬁsheries, though the
discards and IUU of industrial ﬁsheries are almost the same magnitude.
Globally, many ﬁsheries that are managed have been compelled to reduce discarding and to increase the proportion of catch that is reported.
In some countries, particularly with tropical bottom trawling, what was
once discarded is returned to shore to feed aquaculture operations. This
could be a signiﬁcant and growing trend as tropical trawling is extensive [22]. This change to ‘discarding’ practices increases eﬃciency
in the human-use of killed fauna but also increases net export of biomass from marine systems with unknown consequences. Indeed, this
value-added practice may even increase the collateral damage caused
by ﬁshing even reducing incentives for other changes such as increasing
gear speciﬁcity that would protect vulnerable non-target species and
critical marine habitats.

3.2. Mapping industrial marine catch since 1869
Though the global geographic scope of industrial ﬁshing was undoubtedly limited before the 1900s, the reporting was similarly poor.
Records available include just three ﬁshing countries: Canada, the USA

Substantial increases to ﬁsh and seafood consumption was increasingly
supported by expansions to marine and freshwater aquaculture, although feed for these farms often came from marine stocks – forage
ﬁshes. While important to farming ﬁsh these species, often small pelagics, have important roles in marine food webs [33,34] and support
marine mammals and seabirds [35].
In Fig. 2c and d it is clear that the inclusion of additional spatial
information from tuna rFMOs and from the AIS satellite data more recently has allowed relative hot-spots of ﬁshing on the high seas to be
highlighted more precisely than previous attempts [7]. Increases to
spatial precision will have special signiﬁcance to investigations of the
interaction of ﬁsheries and sensitive habitats and/or wildlife. Because
ﬁsheries can consume the same species as marine predators it is important to be able to make use of all spatial detail available [35–38] as
the energetics of foraging by some species are not nearly as generous as
fossil fuels allow ﬁshing ﬂeets.

3.4. Composition of global industrial catch since 1869
The composition of global marine catch has changed since the 1880s
(Fig. 4a). Although less is known about catch composition before 1900,
most landings were demersal ﬁshes though there have always been
reported landings of small pelagics for at least 800 years [20,39]. Following the industrial expansion post World War II, ﬁsheries landings
increased and included in this was a vast expansion of small pelagics
such as come from the rich upwelling areas, which were then intensively ﬁshed. In more recent years there has been a relative expansion of valuable landings of tunas, shrimps and squid reﬂecting the
ability of ﬂeets to roam widely, work at night and use energy-intensive
methods of ﬁshing supported by modern technology in an attempt to
meet increasing demands for varied seafoods.
3.5. Fishing gears associated with global catch
Although the association of ﬁshing gear to reported landings could
not be extrapolated back in time beyond the 1950s there had already
been substantial changes in ﬁshing practices since the 1880s. Sails and
oars were replaced with steam and eventually diesel propulsion. Ice
allowed longer trips and, with the introduction of freezers, vessel endurance and range greatly expanded. Vessels were faster and more
powerful, and capable of facing the winds and waves of all seasons.
Fishing at night became possible and, for some trawled species, ﬁnally
allowed ﬁshing to occur when predator-wary species like prawns were
active and available. Trawling gears evolved to cover large areas of the
bottom and drive small ﬁsh shoals into the nets. Sonar and radar guided
vessels and ﬁshing gear for safety and eﬀectiveness. Available data only
allows a brief glimpse into the important and complex development of
ﬁshing [40].
Association of ﬁshing gear with catch shows that the relative use of
ﬁshing gears has changed since 1950 (Fig. 4b). Proportionately, the
most obvious change is the increase in bottom trawling [22] while the
use of seine ﬁshing gear appears to have declined. Midwater trawling
which requires guidance by newer technologies such as sophisticated

3.3. Country share of global reported industrial landings
During the development of global marine ﬁshing over the last
century and a half, the dominance of individual countries has changed
many times. No doubt greatly inﬂuenced by what reporting records
were available, initially Canada and the USA dominated the world as
well as Japan (Fig. 3a). By the 1900s, more countries were reporting
(35 in total) (Fig. 3b). The UK joined Japan and the USA to have the
greatest shares of the increasing global landings.
Since 1950 there have been 192 reporting ‘countries’. Japan was the
leader in the period to 2000 (Fig. 3c) followed by the USSR (as it then
was), Peru (where anchoveta stocks supplied one of the world's most
productive ﬁsheries) followed by China, USA, Canada and India.
Since then (Fig. 3d) China has continued to increase its ﬁshing ﬂeets
and landings, and now dominates. While Peru's anchoveta ﬁshery were
still important there were also huge volumes of Pollock landed in
Alaska – also used primarily as a fodder ﬁsh.

depths.
With climate change comes new challenges. The distribution and
productivity of stocks currently supplying seafood and income to many
of the world's populations will likely change [48,49]. In all likelihood,
there will be interest in adjusting ocean acidity and sequestering
greenhouse gases in the oceans. These activities will have international,
and as yet, poorly understood impacts on marine systems and the services mankind currently depends on. Continued development and use
of all technologies is required to maintain productive and diverse
marine environments to safeguard the future food security that the sea
can provide. The increasingly sophisticated data processing of AIS inputs is rapidly increasing their contribution to monitoring global ﬁshing
[50]. Future surveillance will include greater use of satellite technology
such as NOAA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to
add ‘night vision’ to the sophisticated repurposed data coming from
other vessel signals such as AIS. Unique QR codes for valuable ﬁsh
products, combined with block chain technologies will strengthen traceability and help combat illegal ﬁshing. These technologies and more
will also be vital if marine protected areas are used to protect oﬀshore
areas [10,19] where patrols are costly or ineﬀective. Managing conﬂicting uses will be very challenging in remote areas because marine
resources will only become more valuable.
Humans have had a long association with marine resources, indeed,
they may have ensured our very survival in the past [51] but our use of
marine resources through ﬁshing has changed remarkably since the
1800s. Much can be learnt from looking at historical patterns of ﬁshing,
and they can help make decisions vital to maintaining the marine resources and their environments that mankind all depends on - now and
in an uncertain future.

sonar arrangements has also increased. This does suggest that although
our use of energy to ﬁsh has been high for decades it may have continued to increase [41,42]. Nevertheless, at least some ﬁshing operations compare favorably with the energy expenditure required in landbased food production systems [43]. Bottom trawling has additional
implications to marine habitats as it has high levels of non-targeted
catch and is well known to often damage or even remove important
substrates and sessile organisms.

4. Conclusions
Fishing has coevolved with humans and has been vital to our survival since prehistoric times. Our technologies have adapted and allowed ﬁshing in all but the most extreme environments [40]. Mapping
global marine catch is very important for a variety of reasons, not least
because the push to increase wild ﬁsh capture often appears to conﬂict
directly with the accepted need to maintain marine ecosystems at their
most diverse, resilient and productive causing much division in the
marine science community. Perhaps best tackled at a smaller scale
(national or less) it is nevertheless valuable to get an all-inclusive
overview if possible, and to see how things have changed over time
[44]. The challenges are great in inshore waters; however, they now
increasingly extend to high seas areas and to greater depths [45]. Indeed, of necessity, more and more ﬁshing and marine conservation
interests have become partners of mutual concern as marine resources
are pursued by mining, petroleum and other industries. Who would
have imagined that the petroleum industry's widely used seismic survey
methods could kill the zooplankton vital to marine ecosystems [46]?
Though some estimate that our living marine resources such as mesopelagics may be huge [47], understanding marine food webs remains
vital, including through detailed mapping, to avoid overestimating
what can be safely removed. Man will have to know much more before
it can be deemed safe to sequester greenhouse gases into the ocean
