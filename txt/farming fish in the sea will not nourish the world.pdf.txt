Recent literature on marine ﬁsh farming brands it as potentially compatible with sustainable
resource use, conservation, and human nutrition goals, and aligns with the emerging policy
discourse of ‘blue growth’. We advance a two-pronged critique. First, contemporary narratives tend to overstate marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture’s potential to deliver food security and
environmental sustainability. Second, they often align with efforts to enclose maritime space
that could facilitate its allocation to extractive industries and conservation interests and
exclude ﬁshers. Policies and investments that seek to increase the availability and accessibility of affordable and sustainable farmed aquatic foods should focus on freshwater
aquaculture.

A

rapidly growing and high-proﬁle science and policy literature presents marine aquaculture as the forefront of environmentally responsible food production1–7. Futurologists
and aquaculture advocates have long promoted ‘farming the seas’ as a technological and
spatial ﬁx for apparent constraints to terrestrial food production. We identify a ‘new wave’ of
marine aquaculture literature that diverges from this narrative in three important ways. (1) It
replaces ad hoc claims about the potential of marine aquaculture with a coordinated set of
narratives. In combination, these rebrand marine ﬁnﬁsh farming from an ecologically damaging
and inequitable activity, to one potentially compatible with sustainable resource use, conservation, and human nutrition goals. (2) It locates the future of marine aquaculture in offshore
waters; a vast zone previously beyond the bounds of existing technology, now positioned as a
new frontier for expansion8–10. (3) It is advanced by new coalitions of actors, including conservation NGOs and ﬁsheries scientists which previously tended to oppose marine aquaculture.
We make the case that this shift in the contemporary scientiﬁc debate stems from an alignment with the emerging policy discourse of ‘blue growth’11,12 and provide a two-pronged
critique.
First, we contend that the ‘new wave’ of literature is empirically inaccurate regarding the
potential of marine aquaculture to contribute to global food and nutrition security and environmental sustainability, especially with respect to offshore ﬁnﬁsh farming. The economics of
operating in exposed offshore environments necessitate production of high market value, carnivorous ﬁsh species that would remain inaccessible to low-income consumers and the foodinsecure, even given signiﬁcant technological advances.
Second, we suggest that contemporary science and policy narratives around marine aquaculture, and the alliances of actors that propagate them, contribute—through their alignment
with the blue growth policy agenda—to a global drive to create and enclose maritime territory

through the extension of private property rights that would
accelerate allocation of the oceans to extractive industries and
conservation interests. Marine enclosures facilitated by ‘blue
growth’ could exclude and displace coastal ﬁshers, who presently
account for the vast majority of ocean users13,14, potentially
eroding the signiﬁcant contributions that small-scale ﬁsheries
make to human nutrition14,15.
Our critique is based on inductive analysis of key themes in
recent peer-reviewed literature and policy documents on marine
aquaculture, identiﬁed through an extensive review. Throughout
this paper, we present statements and quotes from the literature
to illustrate how narratives around mariculture are constructed
using claims that draw on, and advance, the blue growth agenda.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we identify the major
themes in recent marine aquaculture literature, and examine how
these reproduce, and diverge from, the earlier literature. Second,
we assess the empirical validity of recent claims about the
potential of marine aquaculture to contribute to food and
nutrition security and environmental sustainability. Third, we
show how marine aquaculture is being reframed as compatible
with conservation objectives. Fourth, we critically evaluate recent
estimates of spatial potential for the expansion of marine aquaculture. Fifth, we explore how new alliances of actors formed
around marine aquaculture contribute to a larger drive to commodify the oceans.
We conclude that marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture would largely fail
to deliver the food and nutrition security and environmental
sustainability gains claimed due to biological, technical, and
economic constraints. On the contrary, the expansion of marine
aquaculture may intensify pressure on marine resources, and fuel
exclusionary and inequitable social outcomes similar to those
associated with ‘green grabs’ by conservation organizations on
land16,17. We contend that the future of most farmed aquatic food
production—including that with the greatest potential to contribute to food and nutrition security and equity goals—lies not in
the sea, but on land. At sea, small-scale capture ﬁsheries have
greater potential to meet food and nutrition security and equity
goals than most forms of marine ﬁnﬁsh farming.
(Re)imagining marine aquaculture
The idea that ‘farming the seas’ is an inevitable next step for
humanity rapidly approaching limits to the growth of terrestrial
food production is an old one. Quotes articulating a perceived
need for marine aquaculture spanning almost six decades from
1952 to 2009, are presented in Table 1. All invoke urgent limits to
terrestrial food production, counterposed with the yet-to-berealized spatial ﬁx of expansion into marine environments.
This deterministic mix of Malthusian anxiety and biotechnological utopianism18 is also central to the new wave of marine
aquaculture literature. Recent literature emphasizes—in broad
terms—a global crisis, entailing a growing, seafood-hungry
population, collapsing capture ﬁsheries, freshwater scarcity,
competition for agricultural land, and conﬂicts over coastal space.
This scenario, it is claimed, will drive the future of aquatic food
production into increasingly distant offshore regions of the

oceans7–9,19,20. The effect of this crisis narrative is to frame a
series of contextually speciﬁc and highly variegated processes as
universal trends. To cite but one example, whereas global capture
ﬁsheries decline is often taken as a given, many ‘collapsed’ stocks
have recovered21, and many tropical multi-species, multi-gear,
artisanal ﬁsheries—which particularly make important contributions to food and nutrition security—display a high degree of
resilience to ﬁshing pressure22.
We identify three ways in which the new literature diverges
from the old. (1) It marshals additional layers of mutually reinforcing claims. (2) It involves a diverse mix of actors, including
groups once broadly opposed to marine aquaculture. (3) It contributes to advancement of a new market-based political project23: ‘blue growth’.
‘New’ claims in the contemporary literature can be summarized as follows. First, (reversing earlier popular representations)
rather than driving inequitable outcomes for human food and
nutrition security, marine aquaculture “has the potential to
beneﬁt malnourished populations”24. Second, (also reversing
earlier representations by environmentalists) marine aquaculture
“could be one of the most ecologically sustainable forms of food
production”3. Third, marine ﬁsh farms can be “compatible with
conservation objectives”, including the establishment of marine
protected areas (MPAs)25. Fourth, geospatial modelling reveals a
“vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture”5. Fifth, an
apparent disjuncture between the urgent need for marine aquaculture and its unrealized potential can be explained in terms of
policy failures8,26 that can (and, normatively, should) be remedied through marine spatial planning6 and expansion of private
property regimes at sea3.
Following sections of the paper elaborate on and critically
evaluate each set of claims. We contend that the cumulative logic
of these claims aligns with the blue growth agenda of deepening
marine private property regimes, and that this goal underpins
support for marine aquaculture by some conservation advocates
and ﬁsheries scientists.
Food and nutrition security and environmental sustainability
In this section, we critically evaluate claims in the recent scientiﬁc
and policy literature on the potential of marine aquaculture to
contribute to food and nutrition security and environmental
sustainability. We ﬁnd that these claims fail to adequately account
for the bio-economic characteristics of the organisms farmed and
technologies required to produce them. As a result, they obscure
the likely distributional consequences and environmental
externalities of expanding production and exaggerate potential for
sectoral growth.
Recent literature emphasizes food production as marine
aquaculture’s core function. This is evident from papers and
policy documents with titles such as, Global opportunities for
mariculture development to promote human nutrition24, How
can mariculture better help feed humanity?27, Food from the
Oceans7, and The future of food from the sea2,3. Collectively, the
literature asserts that increased production of farmed marine food
has the potential to enhance seafood consumption by humans3.

PERSPECTIVE

Table 2 Recent statements about marine aquaculture, food and nutrition security, and environmental sustainability.
Food and nutrition security
• Increased mariculture production could help ameliorate global malnutrition24.
• Mariculture offers a crucial supply of protein, and… can support nutritionally vulnerable communities1.
• [Offshore ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture] operations could be sited in developing countries to increase food security through income generation or increased
access to seafood9.
Environmental sustainability
• Part of the growing interest in offshore aquaculture is the potential for improved sustainability. By moving farther offshore into the less protected ocean
environment, open-ocean farming has the potential to reduce some of the many negative impacts associated with more nearshore practices and even
create positive impacts through greater resource efﬁciency use28.
• Offshore aquaculture is increasingly viewed as a mechanism to meet growing protein demand for seafood, while minimizing adverse consequences on
the environment19.
• Offshore mariculture aquaculture could enable increased seafood production and economic development while alleviating pressure on coastal
ecosystems and wild ﬁsheries10.

Although some publications have little to say about how this
additional seafood would be distributed, others make explicit,
though unelaborated, claims about its potential contributions to
food and nutrition security (see Table 2).
Representations of marine aquaculture as an environmentally
sustainable form of food production draw on three sets of claims.
(1) Seaweeds and most molluscs are extractive feeders, requiring
little or no external feed inputs or supplementary nutrients3,7. (2)
Siting marine ﬁsh cages in offshore environments exposed to
strong currents and wave action minimizes point source pollution
that can occur when farms are sited in protected nearshore
environments10,19,28. (3) Improvements in feed formulation
reduce the adverse environmental impacts of marine ﬁnﬁsh
production3,7,29 (see Table 2). We address these points in
turn below.
First, the potential of seaweeds and ﬁlter-feeding molluscs
(bivalves) to contribute signiﬁcantly to food and nutrition
security falls short of their attractive resource use proﬁles. Leading seaweed industry experts estimate that global production of
seaweeds stands at about half the quantity reported by the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)30.
Seaweed is currently eaten directly in a limited range of forms;
principally as soups, soup stock, sushi wrap, salads, and dried
snacks31. Direct seaweed consumption per capita in Japan (which
has the largest consumption per capita globally, along with
Korea) has been reported at around 5.3 g/capita/day (<2 kg/
capita/year). This level of consumption has been stable for decades32. Seaweeds consumed directly as food are likely to remain a
minor component of future diets, with only niche markets outside
East Asia33 and some Paciﬁc islands. Growth of global seaweed
production over the past decade has been driven mainly by
expanding Indonesian output, which is used mostly for industrial
carrageenan extraction34. Seaweed extracts are used by the food
industry as thickening agents and gels in ultra-processed foods,
such as confectionary, ice cream, desserts, and processed meats31.
These types of food are often of limited nutritional value and can
contribute negatively to human health when consumed in
excess35.
The contribution of bivalves to world food supplies is also
smaller than FAO statistics (based on ‘wet weight equivalents’
that include the weight of inedible shell) would suggest (Table 3).
Yield of edible meat from bivalves averages 17% of live weight,
whereas, the edible yield of ﬁnﬁsh averages 87%. The apparent
contribution of bivalves to world food supplies is thus biased
dramatically upward in direct comparisons with ﬁnﬁsh36. There
is potential to make greater use of mollusc extracts in highly
processed functional foods37 but these are of limited relevance to
global food and nutrition security. Bivalves are nutritious, and

some farmed species such as mussels are relatively affordable.
Nevertheless, demand in most markets, and thus contributions to
food supply at the global scale, are presently rather limited. For
these reasons, we conﬁne our analysis in the remainder of this
article to the production of marine ﬁnﬁsh.
Second, exposed marine environments are far more technically
challenging arenas for ﬁnﬁsh farming than nearshore waters or
land-based farms. Operational challenges and expenses increase
with distance from shore, in the form of fuel costs and adaptations required to operate in high energy environments. Adaptations include reinforced and submersible cage structures, high
levels of automation38, and large farm sizes to capture economies
of scale39,40. As a result, R&D, ﬁxed capital, and operating costs
for open-ocean aquaculture are high40. This makes offshore
aquaculture a relatively high-cost way of growing ﬁsh that is
presently able to compete with inshore aquaculture only under
limited circumstances41. We contend that the economics of offshore marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture therefore necessitate industrialscale cultivation of high market value species or products to offset
production costs39,40,42.
Most high market value ﬁnﬁsh species with potential for use in
marine aquaculture are carnivorous. Their production requires
feeds containing marine ingredients (ﬁsh meal and/or ﬁsh oil), or
substitutes such as microalgae derivatives that are under development and are currently expensive. As a result, the cost of
production of most marine ﬁsh is high relative to herbivorous/
omnivorous freshwater ﬁsh, such as carps, catﬁsh, and tilapia that
readily assimilate high levels of cheaper terrestrial plant-based
ingredients in diets43. The ability to breed and farm freshwater
ﬁsh at low cost using relatively basic technologies44, makes them
accessible to low- and middle-income consumers in countries
with high levels of supply45, as well as to small- and mediumscale producers who beneﬁt from farming them. The opposite is
true of marine aquaculture, especially offshore, where high ﬁxed
and operating costs prevent participation by all but large investors. Job creation associated with offshore farms would be limited
mainly to onshore ﬁsh processing which will increasingly be
automated46.
We believe that, even allowing for improvements in technical
efﬁciency and scale economies, most species promoted as candidates for marine ﬁnﬁsh farming will be unable to compete on
price with those that make up the bulk of freshwater aquaculture,
and will not become accessible to low-income consumers.
Salmon—the main ﬁnﬁsh presently farmed in marine environments—provides a relevant example. Salmon farming has been
subject to half a century of intensive R&D, great leaps in production efﬁciency, massive levels of industrial consolidation, and
consistently declining real farmgate prices47, yet, high production

costs mean that salmon remains a relative luxury, inaccessible to
anyone outside the global middle class.
Planned investments in offshore aquaculture farms in China
provide similar insight into the relationship between species
choice, production economics, and distributional outcomes.
Investments in offshore ﬁnﬁsh farming projects totaling >USD 1
billion are planned, though none has been established to date48.
Among ten major offshore aquaculture projects currently proposed in Chinese waters, three are slated to produce salmon, three
to produce large yellow croaker, and the others a mix of luxury
species that include Japanese seabass, puffer ﬁsh, tuna, and yellowtail amberjack49. Projects such as these, if eventually realized,
would do little to contribute to global food and nutrition security,
ameliorate malnutrition, or support nutritionally vulnerable
people.
The high market value marine ﬁnﬁsh species that would
dominate offshore marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture require diets containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids to ensure ﬁsh health and
welfare, and to maintain nutritional value for humans50. Until
now, marine ingredients derived from wild caught ﬁsh have been
the principal source of omega-3 fatty acids in ﬁsh feeds. Alternative algal based aqua-feed ingredients are currently under
development51 and some are now reaching the market. It seems
probable that these products will start to substitute for ﬁsh oils as
a key source of omega-3 in feeds, but the investment required
means that prices are likely to remain high, limiting their use to
the diets of high value species52, and meaning that they are
unlikely to serve as an alternative source of protein (i.e., as a ﬁsh
meal replacement).
Proponents of marine aquaculture point to the role of
improvements in feed formulation technology to overcome the
‘ﬁsh meal trap’, by the substitution of plant-source proteins
such as soybean cake for ﬁsh meal in the diets of carnivorous
ﬁsh3,7,29. However, improvements in the efﬁciency of marine
ingredient use for farmed salmon53 have been achieved in
combination with expensive selective breeding programs. Such
genetic improvement programs are generally only economically
viable for species produced in very large volumes. Salmon
accounted for 30% of marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture in 2018,
among more than 100 marine ﬁnﬁsh species farmed54. It cannot be assumed that other marine species will follow a similar
4

Marine

development pathway to salmon or achieve equally large
improvements in performance.
Signiﬁcant growth of marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture would therefore entail, at the minimum, a short-term increase in demand for
marine feed ingredients. Current interest in intensifying the
exploitation of mesopelagic ﬁsh stocks7,55 for use in aquaculture
feeds underlines this point. Demand for marine feed ingredients
has already altered marine ecosystems56. Increasing demand
further has the potential to cause unsustainable levels of exploitation of some ﬁsh stocks57 and to compromise the food
and nutrition security of nutritionally vulnerable populations if
utilization of ﬁsh in aqua-feeds competes with human
consumption58.
Although improvements in feed formulation and breeding
have the potential to lessen dependence on conventional marine
ingredients, inclusion of higher levels of terrestrial ingredients in
feeds would also lead to burden-shifting and ecological tradeoffs59,60. For instance, complete substitution of ﬁsh meal in
shrimp diets with terrestrial feed ingredients has the potential to
increase demand for freshwater by up to 63%, land by up to 81%,
and phosphorous by up to 83%, meaning that the sustainability of
substituting ﬁsh meal with plant ingredients should not be taken
for granted60.
Third, life cycle assessment studies show consistently that the
most signiﬁcant adverse environmental impacts of fed aquaculture in both marine and freshwater environments derive from
the global effects of feed production61,62. Recent mariculture literature tends to view land use and freshwater consumption primarily as a question of direct on-farm utilization. Expansion of
fed aquaculture anywhere, including in offshore marine environments, would create tele-coupled demand for space, freshwater,
and ecosystem services on land. Siting ﬁsh cages offshore may
attenuate some of the worst effects of point source pollution
emanating from farms10,19 but cannot address these global
impacts, and may exacerbate some of them. For example, life
cycle assessment indicates that fuel consumed by boats providing
transport to and from offshore ﬁnﬁsh farms can contribute a large
share of overall environmental impact, concentrated particularly
in the impact categories of cumulative energy demand, acidiﬁcation, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidation, and
global warming63.

Table 4 Claims about potential for spatial expansion of marine aquaculture.
• [W]e ﬁnd vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to
meet foreseeable seafood demand5.
• [I]f all areas designated as suitable in this analysis were developed… we estimate that ~15 billion tonnes of ﬁnﬁsh could be grown every year—over 100
times the current global seafood consumption5.
• If only the most productive areas of the ocean were developed for ﬁsh aquaculture, the amount of seafood that is currently captured by all wild
ﬁsheries could be grown using less than 0.015% of the ocean’s surface area—a surface area less than Lake Michigan5.
• [T]he Caribbean’s potential to produce cobia from mariculture is extremely large, with an approximate total annual production from suitable sites
of 43.1 MMT10.
• The Caribbean could match its current seafood production by farming cobia in just 179 km2 (0.006%) of its marine space10.

Conservation aquaculture
A dramatic shift has recently taken place in the way that conservation interests engage with marine aquaculture. Early literature on open-ocean aquaculture by environmental NGOs was
highly critical, concluding that offshore ﬁnﬁsh farms would
replicate many of the environmental problems documented as
affecting inshore salmon aquaculture at that time, such as efﬂuent
discharges, disease transmission to wild stocks, and ﬁsh escapes64.
Escapes may be associated with interbreeding and competition
between farmed and wild ﬁsh, and the introduction of non-native
species65.
Recent literature has drawn attention to potential synergies
between marine aquaculture and conservation1,25,66–68 and
advocated enthusiastically for collaboration between these interest
groups66,68.
Papers espousing this view rewrite longstanding narratives
regarding marine aquaculture’s incompatibility with conservation
and make the case for, “shifting the narrative and paradigm
of aquaculture’s role in resource management”66. This movement
was preceded by work contending that ﬁsh farms act as
ﬁsh aggregating devices, meaning that creating no-ﬁshing zones
at farms would provide greater resilience for ﬁsh stocks
where coastal aquaculture is practiced68. Recent work from
conservation organizations suggests that aquaculture may be
preferable to other uses proposed in multiple-use MPAs,
including ﬁsheries25.
The potential of marine aquaculture to facilitate exclusion of
ﬁshers from clearly deﬁned areas of oceanic space, thereby
facilitating protection for wild ﬁsh stocks, is attractive to some
conservationists. This logic leads one set of authors to conclude
that, “Over the last 20 years, marine aquaculture and conservation have been largely opposing forces. To secure the best deal for
coastal ﬁsh stocks, ﬁsh-farmers and conservationists should work
together”68. Other commentators are even more optimistic,
stating, “The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests
a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to
address global issues”66. As we show in the ﬁnal section of this
paper, the blue growth policy agenda has provided impetus for
these alliances to ﬂourish.
Potential for spatial expansion
A proliferation of recent studies has sought to demonstrate
untapped potential of marine aquaculture through geospatial
analyses and modelling exercises, incorporating parameters that
include the physiological requirements and growth rates of candidate ﬁsh species, marine hydrography, habitat suitability,
operational suitability, and competing uses of ocean
space5,6,10,20,69–71. These studies claim to reveal the existence of
vast areas of ocean well-suited to marine aquaculture, holding
“remarkable potential”10 to produce quantities of seafood far in
excess of current levels of demand, if utilized for this purpose
(Table 4). Projections reported in these studies are products of the

models deployed. One prominent global study derived its estimates by assuming no further economic, environmental, or social
constraints to production5. This approach has been challenged
with respect to ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture on the basis that feed availability and feed costs would prevent further expansions of mariculture long before any ocean space limitations are reached42.
A study of the potential of cobia farming in the Caribbean
found that projected production would drop from a headline
result of 43.1 million tonnes/year to below 1.5 million tonnes/year
if the price of cobia fell just 13% below its present market rate of
USD 8.62 kg10. Even this lower bound estimate of potential
production appears highly improbable in light of current ﬁgures.
Producing 1.5 million tonnes/year of farmed cobia would equate
to a supply increase several orders of magnitude over the current
total global output of farmed and wild cobia54. We believe that
such a large increase in production, even if realized over a long
period of time, would likely drive down cobia prices far below the
current market value, undermining the economic viability of the
industry and limiting its scope for expansion long before projected production volumes were reached.
The magnitude of the discrepancy between the potential for
marine aquaculture expansion that these studies claim to reveal,
and the material realities that would confront attempts to increase
production on such as scale, cast doubt on the empirical validity
of these projections. Rather, we argue that studies such as these
may serve to produce the following effects:
First, in combination with narratives that frame an imminent
crisis in global ﬁsh supplies and position marine aquaculture as
compatible with food and nutrition security, environmental sustainability and conservation objectives, they create a discursive
terrain in which marine aquaculture appears possible, necessary,
desirable, and ultimately, inevitable72.
Second, through the technology of geospatial mapping, they
render the oceans ‘legible’73 and amenable to technical planning
initiatives74 that facilitate the division and allocation of ocean
space among ‘resource users’ and the provision of exclusive access
rights, based on criteria that appear objective and a-political75.
Policy failures
Marine offshore aquaculture proponents seek to explain the gap
between apparently massive potential and lackluster development
to date in terms of past policy failures8,26. A recent high-proﬁle
policy report poses the question “If the potential [for mariculture]
is so large, why is our production so low?” and answers, “This
large gap is likely driven in part by prohibitive regulatory barriers
in many countries”3. ‘Policy failures’ are characterized in the
literature as taking the form of: (1) excessive regulation based on
the precautionary principle2,3; (2) inadequate or absent regulation, allowing unrestricted expansion of aquaculture with negative environmental externalities2,3; (3) complex, ambiguous and
overlapping regulations that hamper investments8.
Absence of private property rights for the sea has been invoked
as a key underlying institutional constraint, preventing farms

from excluding other users from their production sites76, and
discouraging investments, including R&D, that are necessary
for the industry to grow3. Marine spatial planning utilizing
geospatial information is framed as enabling the zoning of
oceanic space for efﬁcient allocation among resource users that—
in combination with private property rights and streamlined
permitting processes—would create ‘win-win’ solutions for all8,77.
Blue growth and the future of ‘blue foods’
In this ﬁnal section, we conclude by addressing two sets of
questions. First, why have these narratives emerged as a cohesive
whole at this time, and what purpose do they serve? Second,
where does the future of aquatic food production, including that
with the greatest potential to contribute to food and nutrition
security lie?
The narratives summarized in this paper intersect with and
converge around the wider policy discourse of ‘blue growth’,
which heralds the oceans as a new frontier for investment across
multiple economic sectors11,12,78,79. An upsurge in interest in the
ocean economy has encouraged the formation of new coalitions
of actors and revitalized longstanding claims about the potential
of marine aquaculture. This dynamic is illustrated by a recent
report published by a large environmental NGO and an ‘impact
investment ﬁrm’, that estimates that the aquaculture sector will
require an additional USD 150–300 billion in capital investment
by 2030. The report states that it seeks to catalyze greater
investment into more sustainable marine aquaculture, to “create
alternatives to wild caught ﬁsheries and more resource intensive
forms of land-based protein production while ensuring protection
of marine ecosystems”38.
Many of the papers cited here are a product of similar new
institutional alliances, based on academic research contributed to,
or ﬁnancially supported, by leading environmental NGOs, or
produced with funding from philanthropies and foundations that
promote
marine
conservation1,5,6,8,10,19,25,28,29,66,76,77,80,81.
Research co-produced in this way includes papers advancing
many of the most spectacular and newsworthy of claims. These
articles provide much of the content for recent inﬂuential policy
documents promoting the blue economy3,4.
This conjuncture suggests that some marine conservation
groups, given a choice between marine aquaculture and capture
ﬁsheries, now consider aquaculture the lesser of two evils. These
groups have formed alliances with academics, businesses, investors and governments attracted to marine aquaculture’s potential
to advance a key goal: the zoning of marine space. This would
enable the expansion of MPAs, while strengthening forms of
governmentality necessary for other forms of extractive marine
industry to ﬂourish82,83.
In this way, the discourse of blue growth works to create
conditions ripe for the appropriation of oceanic space for the
beneﬁt of private capital and conservation interests17. This trend
mirrors well-documented processes of ‘green grabbing’ on land,
under which, similar coalitions of actors advance crisis narratives
that justify processes of ﬁnancialization, state intervention, and
enclosure and privatization of land and natural resources in the
service of conservation and avowedly ‘green’ schemes such as
carbon offsetting and biofuel production16. Blue economy
initiatives led by state, commercial, and conservation interests,
and associated forms of governmentality such as marine spatial
planning are already contributing to the displacement of coastal
ﬁshers from customary ﬁshing grounds82,84,85. Our interpretation
is that the push to expand marine aquaculture is part of attempts
by these actors to lay claim to and/or intensify the use of oceanic
space and resources79.

Turning to the future of aquatic foods and their contributions
to food and nutrition security, our analysis of the literature
indicates that the new wave of marine aquaculture literature rests
on a series of questionable assumptions. Most farmed aquatic
foods originate from land-based freshwater production systems
that are not fundamentally resource constrained36,86. The extremely rapid growth of terrestrial aquaculture over the past three
decades shows little sign of abating in volume terms36. Much
recent growth in production has occurred through intensiﬁcation
rather than horizontal expansion, enabling higher levels of farm
productivity per unit land and water45. For example, Vietnam’s
entire production of pangasius catﬁsh, which stands at around
one million tonnes per year, takes place on an area of 6000
hectares, equivalent to just 0.08% of the country’s total area of rice
ﬁelds87.
The growth of terrestrial aquaculture has made farmed freshwater ﬁsh widely available and accessible to low- and middleincome consumers in countries that account for the majority of
the world’s aquaculture production45, and makes important
contributions to food and nutrition security by complementing
ﬁsh supplies from inland and marine capture ﬁsheries88.
As established above, the bio-economics of ﬁnﬁsh production
in offshore marine environments necessitates production of
expensive carnivorous species. These cannot compete on price
with relatively cheap herbivorous and omnivorous freshwater
ﬁsh. Low trophic level marine ﬁnﬁsh with similar price proﬁles to
carp, catﬁsh and tilapia do exist. Milkﬁsh and mullets, farmed
mainly in coastal ponds, contribute signiﬁcantly to food and
nutrition security in countries including the Egypt, Indonesia,
and the Philippines89–91. Such modes of farming lack the technofuturistic cachet of offshore cages, and do not require the establishment of new private property regimes. They are virtually
absent from the accounts of marine aquaculture proponents.
Recent developments in the salmon industry suggest that
closed intensive land-based recirculating aquaculture systems
(RAS) are emerging as a viable alternative to cage-based systems.
Unlike marine cages, RAS offer high levels of biosecurity and the
ability to capture and utilize 100% of nutrient wastes. Advances in
renewable energy production seem set to reduce RAS operating
costs92,93, though farming will still likely be restricted to high
value products.
Coastal ﬁsheries already play an extremely important role in
providing livelihoods14,94 and readily accessible nutritious aquatic
foods14,15,58 in the Global South. By reframing offshore marine
aquaculture as a viable source of food for the nutritionally vulnerable, blue growth policy discourse may appear to obviate the
need for coastal ﬁshers, and has the potential to justify their
exclusion from MPAs and new zones of maritime economic
activity, with results that are potentially highly inequitable.
We conclude that marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture in offshore
environments will confront economic, biophysical, and technological limitations that hinder its growth and prevent it from
contributing signiﬁcantly to global food and nutrition security.
Nearshore marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture is likely to continue
expanding in some locations, but will mainly supply expensive
products that contribute little to food and nutrition security or
environmental sustainability, and perhaps undermine them.
Capture ﬁsheries are set to continue to be the source of most food
from the oceans for the foreseeable future. The evidence suggests
that freshwater aquaculture has far greater potential to continue
to supply most of the world’s farmed aquatic food and contribute
to human equity and food security than marine ﬁnﬁsh farming.
Policies and investments that seek to increase the availability and
accessibility of affordable and sustainable farmed aquatic foods
should look to the land95.
