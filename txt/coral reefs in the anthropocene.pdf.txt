Coral reefs support immense biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services to many millions of people. Yet reefs
are degrading rapidly in response to numerous anthropogenic drivers. In the coming centuries, reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change, and rising temperatures will transform them into new configurations, unlike anything observed
previously by humans. Returning reefs to past configurations is no longer an option. Instead, the global challenge is to
steer reefs through the Anthropocene era in a way that maintains their biological functions. Successful navigation of this
transition will require radical changes in the science, management and governance of coral reefs.

A

defining feature of the emerging Anthropocene era is the escalation of numerous pressures, including climate change, globalization and migration, on society and the world’s ecosystems1–4.
Many coastal coral reefs have already been degraded by centuries of
overfishing and pollution, and anthropogenic climate change is exerting further stress, even on remote reefs where local pressures are low
or absent5–9. Increasingly, coral reef scientists and managers encounter
previously unseen configurations of species10–12. The challenges now
are to identify and maintain the ecosystem functions that are crucial for
sustaining coral reefs, and to secure the ecosystem services that highly
altered reef assemblages can provide to people in the future13. Central
to this endeavour is an improved understanding of ecosystem functioning and of the types of management and governance that are effective.
In this Review, we explore the future prospects for coral reefs in
the Anthropocene. First, we examine the implications for coral reefs
of a worldwide shift away from business-as-usual emissions of greenhouse gasses (as agreed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP 21) in Paris) and reassess the future threat of global
warming and ocean acidification to reef biodiversity. Second, we consider whether current experimental evaluations of the impact of rising
temperatures and ocean acidification are appropriately calibrated for
simulating future conditions. Third, we scrutinize the strengths and
weaknesses of conventional scientific approaches to understanding
the cumulative, interacting effects of numerous stresses or drivers of
change on the trajectories of coral reefs. Fourth, we present a conceptual
framework that offers innovative insight into these cumulative impacts
and their effects on the complex dynamics of interlinked social and
ecological systems. Last, we develop a suite of future options for the governance and management of new and unfamiliar coral reef ecosystems.
Sustaining reef biodiversity will require a conceptual shift away from the
current emphasis on protection, conservation or restoration of stable
coral ecosystems at equilibrium, to a reality in which ecosystems are
more dynamic and patchier, as well as increasingly different to anything
that people have encountered before. Embracing this paradigm shift
will necessitate a transformation in the governance and management
of these high-diversity ecosystems.

Running the climate gauntlet

The accelerated effort towards global action on climate change calls
for a reassessment of the environmental conditions that will test coral

reefs in the near future. The goal of the COP 21 Paris agreement14 on
climate change is to constrain the increase in global average temperatures “to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C”. Consequently, the scenario
of 600–1,000 parts per million (p.p.m.) of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
arising from unrestrained business-as-usual emissions, which underpins most of the scientific literature on the projected impacts of rising
temperatures and ocean acidification on coral reefs, is no longer realistic — even if the Paris agreement is only partially successful15. However, it is almost certain that the 1.5 °C target will be exceeded for many
decades16,17. Restraining the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 °C
(with a probability of 66%) would translate into an atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentration of only 410–420 p.p.m. (Fig. 1a) — an amount
that is likely to be surpassed in 3–4 years. Furthermore, representative
concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6, which is the lowest (most optimistic)
greenhouse gas emissions scenario assessed in the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, indicates that
coral reefs will run a gauntlet of hostile environmental conditions for
several centuries, even with a rapid transition to zero emissions18. Reefs
have already experienced three pan-tropical episodes of intense coral
bleaching in the past three decades (1997–1998, 2010 and 2015–2016),
triggered by an average global warming of close to 1 °C above pre-industrial temperatures8,19.
The 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets, based on global average land and sea temperatures, are misleading metrics for understanding future changes to
coral reefs because of differences in the amounts of warming that land
and sea experience20, steep latitudinal gradients in temperature, and
regional discrepancies in rates of warming8. The global average temperature of about 14 °C has little relevance for tropical sea surface temperatures, which, in summer, are typically 27–30 °C, or higher. On the basis
of the HadCRUT4 global temperature data set21, we calculate that the
average tropical sea surface temperature rose by 0.57 °C between 1880
and 2015, which is substantially lower than the 0.88 °C increase in global
average temperature for the same period. Furthermore, the observed
increase in sea surface temperature in the tropics and subtropics since
the late nineteenth century has varied substantially at the regional and
local scales, with 71% of reefs worldwide warming by 0.25–0.75 °C, so
far (Fig. 1b). This spatial heterogeneity suggests that there is no single
‘safe’ level, or planetary boundary2, of global emissions for all coral reefs.
Future increases in temperature will also vary greatly in space and time,

and d, respectively.)

which highlights the need for improved regional-scale modelling that
incorporates more optimistic trajectories of emission reduction.
Future sea surface temperatures under the IPCC’s RCP2.6 scenario
are projected to increase in the short-term (2010–2039) in all major
coral reef provinces, even as global emissions peak and begin to fall. Further warming projections for this period range from 0.32 °C in the eastern Indian Ocean to 0.48 °C in the Caribbean22. From 2039 to 2099, as
sea surface temperatures begin to stabilize, temperatures are projected
to change further in different reef provinces by +0.20 °C to −0.05 °C.
Consequently, the longer-term warming trend, from 2010 to the end of
the twenty-first century, under this low-emissions scenario varies from
0.30 °C to 0.68 °C between reef provinces, an increase that is roughly
equivalent to the warming already observed over the past century.
Even if the 2 °C target of the Paris agreement is achieved, this projected level of warming will still have severe consequences for coral
reefs — particularly when temperatures spike above the long-term
summer maxima, leading to recurrent bleaching events23. However, our
knowledge of the chronic impacts of up to 1 °C of further warming on
the physiology and demography of reef organisms is surprisingly limited because the temperatures used most commonly in recent thermal
experiments are too high (Fig. 1c). Typically, these studies apply one or
more treatments of elevated water temperatures, for periods that last
from a day to a year (or sometimes even longer), to simulate long-term
global warming on coral reefs. So far, the median manipulation of water
temperatures above ambient controls represents an increase of 4 °C (or
of almost 5 °C above the pre-industrial baseline temperature), and no
study has experimentally examined the plausible biological responses to
increases in the range of 0.30–0.68 °C that are projected for various coral

reef regions by RCP2.6 (Fig. 1c). Most manipulations also greatly exceed
the spikes of 1–3 °C above baseline summer maximum temperatures
that cause coral bleaching.
Similarly, shallow-water pH and the saturation state of aragonite,
a form of calcium carbonate, which are crucial for calcification and
other processes on coral reefs24, are likely to change much less than the
extremes that are predicted under higher-emission scenarios. The global
average pH of ocean surface waters has declined in the last 200 years by
about 0.1 units, from pH 8.21 to pH 8.10 (ref. 25). A further decrease of
0.3–0.4 units (to pH 7.7–7.8) would occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations reached 800 p.p.m., causing a contraction towards the
Equator of optimal conditions for calcification26. However, according
to more recent modelling by the IPCC22, an equilibrium atmospheric
concentration of 450 p.p.m. of carbon dioxide would maintain a pH of
7.9–8.1 in most tropical oceanic waters, sustaining a strongly supersaturated aragonite state throughout the tropics and the subtropics. So far,
we find no evidence that the geographic range of calcifying species is
contracting towards the Equator owing to ocean acidification. On the
contrary, as temperatures rise, many species are expanding towards the
north and south into the subtropics, despite small decreases in aragonite
concentration27,28.
Most experiments that are designed to explore the effects of ocean
acidification on corals and other reef organisms have simulated extreme
levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide that are designed to match conditions predicted for the end of the twenty-first century under unconstrained emissions of greenhouse gasses (Fig. 1d). Typically, such
experiments comprise a control, which corresponds to the present-day
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of around 400 p.p.m., and

one or more treatments that manipulate pH or water chemistry. A broad
range of physiological and demographic responses have been measured,
including rates of calcification, growth, reproduction and survival. In
336 manipulations from a sample of 137 published studies (Supplementary Table 1), we found none that specifically simulated a future
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 400–500 p.p.m., the range
that reefs are likely to experience for at least the next century. The lowest
concentrations, which account for 32.7% of manipulations, ranged from
500 to 750 p.p.m. (Fig. 1d). Consequently, our knowledge of the effects
of ocean acidification under conditions of less than 500 p.p.m. of carbon
dioxide is built on the basis of interpolation between ambient controls
and unrealistically high experimental treatments. Of the remaining
manipulations, 33.9% studied concentrations of 750–1,000 p.p.m., and
33.3% evaluated concentrations that were even higher (Fig. 1c) — simulating atmospheric conditions that would generate temperatures of 6 °C
or more that are lethal to corals (Fig. 1a). A similar challenge arises for
field studies of ocean acidification that use naturally occurring locations with a consistently low pH, including volcanic vents or submarine
springs, as a proxy for future climatic conditions. The water chemistry
typically mimics an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of more
than 1,000 p.p.m., but it is necessarily mismatched with current temperatures rather than those predicted for future global warming. Corals
have already been affected by recurrent episodes of mass bleaching and
mortality following exposure to warming of only 1–2 °C above baseline
summer maximum temperatures for periods of 4–8 weeks8,19. Consequently, whereas coral reefs already need to cope with severe global
warming, they may never encounter the projected physiological and
ecological impacts of severe ocean acidification that are simulated in
the experimental literature (Fig. 1d).

Coral reef ecosystem

Clearly, our analysis (Fig. 1c, d) points to an urgent need to recalibrate
both temperature and ocean-acidification experiments to better
understand their interactive, combined impact on coral reefs under
less extreme conditions. According to a statistical analysis of 25 experiments, the rate of calcification by corals declines on average by 15%
per unit decrease in the aragonite saturation state (Ω), over the range of
2 to 4 Ω (ref. 29). However, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would have to double from 400 to 800 p.p.m. to reduce the present
average aragonite saturation state of tropical surface waters (currently
3.01 Ω (ref. 26) by one unit. There is insufficient experimental evidence
to accurately estimate how calcification would decline in response to a
more modest emissions trajectory that peaks far below 800 p.p.m. However, interpolation of the available experimental evidence suggests that
an average decrease in calcification of less than 10% is likely to occur
with an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide of up to 500–550 p.p.m.
Although highly speculative, in the short term, rising average temperatures could promote coral growth and compensate partially for longterm shifts in aragonite concentrations30. For example, on the most
southerly subtropical coast of Western Australia, the calcification rate
of corals from the genus Porites increased by 23.5% between 1900 and
2010, as temperatures rose by 0.10 °C per decade30.
To resolve this uncertainty, there is an urgent need for future experiments to examine the synergy between warming and ocean acidification. This could be achieved by manipulating temperature and water
chemistry incrementally, and by matching them to each other, over a
more realistic range of projected levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
(400–500 p.p.m.). Recalibrating experimental approaches to global
warming and ocean acidification will be challenging because smaller
manipulations in temperature and water chemistry are more difficult to
regulate, and the resulting biological responses will be harder to detect
and quantify.
Although a modest level of oceanic acidification undoubtedly
will have discernable effects, mass bleaching events owing to global
warming, pollution and overfishing are likely to remain the most
pressing challenges for reef biodiversity throughout the twenty-first
century7,13,31,32. We can therefore anticipate a rapid expansion of the
geographic range of corals into higher latitudes27,28, as well as continued
shifts in species composition in response to differences in susceptibility
to climate change and other anthropogenic drivers19,33. The challenge
worldwide is to steer reefs through this period of continued warming,
a fundamentally different mindset to the current focus on managing to
maintain the status quo of coral reefs.

In an era of rapid environmental shifts, social change and unprecedented economic development, the need for improved stewardship
of natural systems worldwide has never been greater or more urgent2.
There is a growing awareness of the considerable influence of people
on the functioning of all ecosystems31,34–36, as well as a renewed evaluation of the dependence of human society on nature for food security,
water, aesthetic and spiritual values, and other ecosystem services that
contribute to human wellbeing (Fig. 2). Securing biodiversity and ecosystems for future generations requires new governance frameworks,
or transformational changes to existing ones, and fresh approaches to
ecosystem management. This task is probably greatest in the tropics,
where the juxtaposition of billions of people with iconic hotspots of
biodiversity presents an unprecedented challenge for securing both
human development and conservation outcomes. Yet, until recently,
ecologists have often ignored human behaviour as the ultimate (or distal) driver of environmental change, focusing instead on more proximal,
smaller-scale drivers of change (Fig. 2). For example, in the coral reef
literature, the grazing rate of herbivorous fishes is often considered to
be an important driver of regime shifts from corals to macroalgae32,37.
However, grazing by herbivorous fishes is diminished by pressure from
fishing, which is itself mediated by more distal social drivers such as
poverty or market demands31,38. Locally, the consumption of reef fish is

BOX 1

A framework for modelling social–ecological dynamics
Models that explicitly include feedbacks and nonlinear interactions
within and between social and ecological systems are essential for
understanding and analysing their intertwined dynamics. Here, we
consider the hypothetical response of fish stocks to the intensity
of fishing (Box 1 Fig. a) and vice versa (Box 1 Fig. b). In both cases,
and depending on the strength of the feedbacks, a spectrum of
responses (grey lines) is possible that range from linear to hysteretic
(s-shaped curve; dotted sections indicate unstable regions).
In a coupled social–ecological system, the simplest interaction
(Box 1 Fig. c) is represented by two intersecting smooth responses,
with a single stable equilibrium at intermediate levels of fishing
intensity and stock size.
Depending on the shapes and intersections of the response curves,
much more complicated dynamics can arise, including one, two,
three or four stable states, and limit cycles. When both the ecological

and social elements exhibit hysteresis owing to strong feedbacks
(Box 1 Fig. d), this can lead to four alternative stable equilibria (I–IV),
which are classified according to the level of fish stocks and high
fishing intensity. Subtle changes in either the social system or the
ecological system can therefore produce profound differences in
social–ecological dynamics. The most probable transitions between
the four equilibria are directional, moving from II (the best-case
scenario of both high fishing intensity and high fish stocks) to IV
(fish stocks have collapsed and fishing remains high) then to III
(both fish stocks and the fishery are degraded) and to I (fish stocks
recover under light fishing). Consequently, the model suggests
that the pathway to return to II (the best-case scenario) when the
coupled system has collapsed to IV would be for both fish stocks and
fishing intensity to decline to III and then shift to I before improving.
Effectively, conditions are likely to get worse before they get better.

shaped by a combination of the size, socio–economic status and cultural
norms of the human population39. By emphasizing proximal drivers
rather than more distal human ones, we often inadvertently simplify
and re-scale a complex social–ecological problem into a subsystem that
is entirely biological, which can distract from the underlying causes and
ways to address them.
A social–ecological approach for sustaining ecosystems is beginning
to emerge that explicitly links the resilience of ecosystems to governance
structures, economies and society2,40–42. Social–ecological models of
various types have already been developed for a number of contexts,
including forestry43, freshwater lakes44, fisheries45 and agricultural abandonment46. Combining human social systems and ecosystems in the
same models reveals further complexity and a richer range of dynamics, which presents new possibilities for sustainable solutions (Box 1).
Death by a thousand cuts
Although climate change now dominates the discussion, it is clearly
not the only threat in the Anthropocene to the biodiversity, ecological functions and ecosystem services of coral reefs7,13,31,32. Approaches
to understanding multi-causality — the interactions between multiple
drivers — in coral reef science often categorize the effects of pairs of
drivers as being additive, antagonistic or synergistic. For example, if
climate change has effect x on the abundance of corals on a reef and
overfishing has effect y, then climate change and overfishing together
may, in theory, have an effect that is x + y, less than x + y or greater
than x + y (ref. 47). In reality, however, the world is not so simple. Both
the science and governance of coral reefs are in great need of stronger
conceptual and methodological frameworks for understanding and
managing multiple drivers and their combined impact.
Currently, the literature on multiple drivers and their impact on
coral reefs focuses on three main strands: short-term laboratory or
field experiments that manipulate two or, rarely, three stressors (for
example, temperature and pH)29; statistical analyses that correlate the

condition of reefs (for example, coral cover or fish biomass) at several
locations or times with a number of factors48,49; and global ecological
assessments made on the basis of multi-layered geographic information systems maps (for example, ocean-health maps or Reefs at Risk
maps)50,51. Each strand can provide valuable insights, but all have considerable limitations. For example, experiments that manipulate drivers
provide an in-depth understanding at only very small scales (from days
to months, and usually in the laboratory) and are therefore unable to
examine spatial dynamics or long-term interactions between species.
Similarly, multiple regression analyses are often confounded by collinearity between explanatory variables. A tacit assumption in many
such analyses, that the current condition of reefs can be explained by
the mix and strength of present-day drivers, discounts the role of time
lags between cause and effect in shaping the non-equilibrial trajectory of
reefs52. Global maps also portray relative risks at large spatial scales, but
they make the unrealistic assumption that stressors are only additive.
Analyses of interacting drivers and multi-causality have undergone
more extensive development in terrestrial ecology, and their application
has improved both the monitoring and management of ecosystems.
For example, in savannas, an in-depth understanding of the interaction between fire, herbivory, predation, rainfall and vegetation has been
central to developing strategies for the sustainable management of large
herbivores53. Others studies have proposed the formal use of a process
of triangulation that compares and contrasts explorations of models,
field studies and laboratory experiments54 to cross-validate theories of
causality. This builds on the idea that a rigorous understanding of multicausality arises from testing hypotheses from a variety of perspectives.
Arguably, current thinking on the responses of ecosystems to one
or more drivers is too linear. The ecological response to even a single
stressor is often curved owing to positive or reinforcing feedbacks; small
levels of drivers have no impact (for example, when pollution is too
dilute or heat stress falls below a threshold) but higher amounts increasingly cause an ecological response55. Thirty types of positive feedback

particularly relevant to the widespread emergence of new drivers that
affect ecosystems and add to the impact of pre-existing stressors, which
themselves are likely to strengthen with time. For example, climate
change and new coastal developments are adding to the now centuryold pressures of overfishing and pollution on marine ecosystems. Here,
modelling supports the proposal that local action to protect reefs from
overfishing and pollution can boost the capacity of reef ecosystems to
survive climate change5,7,10,49,58. Therefore, the potential for making
changes to social and ecological drivers and feedbacks is crucial when
considering avenues for improved governance. Furthermore, the modelled result (Fig. 3) indicates that synergistic human impacts can reduce
resilience and cause unexpected ecological collapse, even when individual drivers or stressors remain at levels that are considered to be safe.

Figure 3 | The modelled response of coral reefs to multiple anthropogenic
drivers. Depending on the strength and interaction between certain
anthropogenic drivers (climate change, nutrient pollution and fishing), three
outcomes are possible: when the drivers are weak, healthy coral-dominated
assemblages form (coral state, red); when the drivers are strong, a state
dominated by macroalgae with few corals forms (green); and when the
drivers are intermediate, alternative states occur (purple). Interfaces between
the coral, alternative and macroalgal states represent the tipping points or
thresholds for each combination of drivers. The coral state collapses if the
stress from any single driver is too strong and is eliminated entirely by the
cumulative impacts of multiple drivers. The width and shape of the region of
alternative stable states depends on the strength of interacting feedbacks. (See
Supplementary Note 1 for further details about the model.)

have already been observed on coral reefs56. Some are ecological or
social and others are both. For example, when fish stocks decline, fishers without access to an alternative livelihood often increase their efforts
and further suppress the stocks. A strong feedback produces a threshold
response, and an even stronger one can cause hysteresis and precipitate
a catastrophic collapse55,57. When several weak feedbacks act simultaneously, they can collectively promote an unexpected regime shift as the
effects of multiple drivers gradually increase56.
An area that holds promise for understanding the role of multiple
drivers and feedbacks in environmental change is the development of
heuristic models. For example, when three drivers (climate change,
overfishing and pollution) are modelled simultaneously (Fig. 3), their
combined effects become more evident, which first results in transitions
from a coral state to alternative states, in which both coral states and
non-coral states can occur, and ultimately leads to conditions in which
only a macroalgal state is possible. Consequently, the model identifies
the concept of a generic ‘safe operating space’ for coral reefs2,4, in which
corals are dominant so long as multiple drivers are held in check below
threshold levels that arise from their combined effects. This result is

The dynamics of coral reefs in the Anthropocene are already dominated
by complex interactions between multiple anthropogenic drivers, which
is resulting in new assemblages of species10,32,37. Increasingly, we face a
fundamentally different reality: it is no longer possible to restore coral
reefs to their past configurations. For example, reefs in the Caribbean
will never resemble the faunal composition of past centuries, owing to
the ecological extinction of megafauna such as turtles and manatees,
the massive decline of the once dominant branching corals of the genus
Acropora, the irreversible introduction of the predatory lionfish (Pterois
volitans) and the ongoing impact of coastal development, overfishing
and climate change7,59. Similarly, following a mass-bleaching event and
unprecedented mortality in 2016, the corals of the remote northern
Great Barrier Reef in Australia are unlikely to have sufficient time to
fully recover their former species composition before further major
bleaching events occur19. Instead of attempting to maintain or restore
historical baseline assemblages, the governance and management of
coral reefs will need to adapt continuously to the new conditions of the
coming centuries.
Biodiversity in a changing world
In recent years, theoretical and empirical studies have provided a robust
framework for understanding the relationship between biodiversity and
ecosystem functioning60. It is also now recognized widely that the morphologic, demographic and life-history traits of species play a central
part in defining ecosystem functioning61 and that biodiversity is more
than just counts of species; it also includes genetic, phylogenetic and
functional diversity60,62–64. However, considerable gaps in our knowledge
remain — in particular, how ecosystem functions will respond to
changing compositions of species that are the result of climate change
and other anthropogenic drivers.
Despite their exceptionally high biodiversity, coral reefs are vulnerable to the loss of functionally important species31,63,64. For example,

ecosystem for a given strength of driver or drivers, and the arrows depict the
change in trajectory that arises from present versus future management. The
relative strength of multiple drivers could be reduced to move the system
away from a dangerous threshold (left). The threshold could be manipulated
to allow the system to handle higher levels of drivers without collapsing
(centre). Multiple feedbacks could be managed to change the shape of the
equilibrium response curve, eliminating the risk of surpassing a tipping
point (right).

reefs support more than 6,000 species of fish, yet crucial functions are
often delivered by just a handful of species. A global analysis of unique
trait combinations of fish showed that about one-third of ecological
functions are performed by only one species63. The proportion of functional groups — sets of species performing the same function — that
are depauperate is consistent regardless of regional species richness,
which suggests that hotspots of high diversity on coral reefs are just as
vulnerable as isolated reefs with low diversity. Consequently, it is becoming clear that biodiversity per se is less important for the maintenance
of reefs than functional composition13,60,65, and examples of this include
the provision of a three-dimensional habitat by branching corals, the
control of macroalgae by herbivores and the breakdown of dead corals
by bioeroders. Identifying and targeting the functions that are required
to maintain reef ecosystems offers an opportunity for fresh approaches
to both the management and restoration of reefs.
Solution spaces
For coral reefs to survive and remain functional into the next century
and beyond, we need to govern and manage them more effectively.
Building on the emerging understanding of nonlinear responses, feedbacks and threshold dynamics in social–ecological systems (Box 1), we
propose three complementary approaches to this endeavour.
First, a greater focus on reducing important drivers of change
could help to avoid crossing thresholds that lead to environmental
degradation (Fig. 4, left). Conversely, drivers that accelerate social
change towards more sustainable practices66 could be increased. The
identification of how several drivers interact (for example, those shown
in Fig. 3) is crucial for effective intervention. Current approaches to
reef conservation, including marine reserves, often seek to limit fishing
in selected areas but rarely address the distal causes of fishery overexploitation such as poverty and market demand48 (Fig. 2). Understanding and tracking distal social drivers may provide an early warning of
unsustainable impacts on reefs before they are detected by ecological
indicators38. The coupling of modern approaches to reef conservation
with sustainable-development initiatives that target distal drivers, for
example, by reducing poverty or encouraging shifts in social norms
(the informal rules that shape people’s attitudes and behaviours) such as
compliance with fishing regulations, can produce both positive social67
and ecological68 outcomes.
Second, there could be opportunities to manipulate ecological thresholds so that stronger drivers are required to induce a regime shift or to
cause unacceptable levels of degradation (Fig. 4, centre). This strategy
seeks ways to ensure that a particular level of a driver, such as pressure
from fishing or climate change, has less of an impact. Examples include:
the introduction of technological innovations such as changes in fishing
gear to reduce environmental damage69; the fostering of social norms
to reduce harmful practices66,70 and to encourage voluntary compliance with environmental laws and regulations71; investment in institutions and processes that help to buffer the deleterious effects that social
drivers such as population size, consumption and access to markets
have on cooperation and collective action72; and altering the composition of ecosystems to increase the proportion of species that are more
tolerant of escalating drivers (for example, heat-tolerant species that
bleach and die at higher temperatures or species that recover faster).
Ecosystem composition change is already occurring naturally, as corals
respond and adapt to climate change (Box 2), and could be promoted
further through efforts to actively manipulate ecosystem configurations.
In social systems, shifts in the composition of society — for example,
through enhanced education or a reduction in poverty — can also
increase resilience to strong drivers such as climate change73.
Last, feedbacks could be actively altered to flatten the slope of the
response curve (Fig. 4, right), therefore reducing the risk of transgressing an unknown threshold or eliminating the threshold altogether. This
approach could involve weakening positive feedbacks that result in a
shift away from a coral-dominated state to an alternative, degraded
ecosystem10,32,56,57. Examples include providing government-backed

BOX 2

The acclimatization and
adaptation of corals
It is becoming clearer that acclimatization and adaptation of
corals to rapid changes in climate is already underway. Individual
species of coral thrive in a variety of habitats and biogeographic
locations because of their capacity to respond to a broad spectrum
of temperatures, at both the physiological and population levels.
Field studies using the reciprocal transplantation of coral clones
also show that individual colonies have the ability to shift their
temperature tolerance99,100. These shifts are associated with
changes in gene expression, the composition and density of
symbionts, or colony growth patterns. Shifts towards partnerships
with more heat-tolerant algal symbionts have also been recorded
in individual colonies, especially after bleaching events101. However,
populations of coral that live in different thermal regimes also show
genetic fixed differences in heat tolerance that are not erased by
acclimatization99,102. Transplants along latitudes of the Great Barrier
Reef103 or from inshore to offshore populations100 show a strong
pattern of adaptation to their local thermal profile.
The mechanisms of local adaptation remain unclear. Genome
scans and mating studies suggest that heat tolerance is influenced
by the action of many genes102,104. However, there are other
opportunities for the evolution of fixed differences between coral
populations besides the influence of classic natural selection on
coral genes. Populations of corals in different reef microhabitats
often differ in the type of symbiont that they acquire on settlement
or following shifts caused by heat stress or the differential effects
of bleaching105. Epigenetic changes through DNA methylation
generate heritable changes in gene expression in reef fish106 and
have also been documented in corals107. These mechanisms, and
the complex adaptive patterns that they produce, do not lend
themselves to simple manipulation through genetic engineering.
Current data strongly show that reef corals exist as a mosaic
of populations that respond physiologically to local heat stress
to lessen damage from high temperatures108. Microhabitats that
experience periodic extremes of temperature can promote heatresistant corals. Such corals will be crucial for the persistence of
coral reefs through the upheavals of the Anthropocene.

incentives for fishers to exit a fishery when stocks decline or breaking
the poverty-trap dynamics that encourage fishing despite low yields in
an overexploited system39,70. Understanding and manipulating feedbacks, thresholds and drivers at a number of scales will be integral to
addressing the escalating problems that confront coral reefs.

Opportunities for action

Helping coral reefs to safely navigate the Anthropocene is a profound
challenge for multiscale governance74. In this context, reef governance
refers to the myriad ways in which societies share knowledge and power,
create policies, build legal frameworks and make decisions. By comparison, the management of coral reefs is the day-to-day business of reef
protection, which is enabled by effective governance. At present, both
the governance and management of coral reefs are typically focused at
the local level and on the regulation of proximal drivers (for example,
pressure from fishing or nearby coastal development). Attention to distal
drivers, including migration, population growth or demand from global
markets, is often limited, fragmented and ineffective39. But in the Anthropocene, progression from local management and monitoring towards the
multiscale governance of drivers, thresholds and feedbacks at relevant
scales will be critically important. Here, we identify a number of potential

INSIGHT REVIEW
opportunities for overcoming this challenge for governance, many of
which fall outside the comfort zone of reef scientists and managers.
Redefining management goals
As reefs continue to reconfigure and decline in the near future, it will be
essential to reconsider management and conservation goals and how
they can be achieved. Conventional management goals often focus
on biodiversity, threatened species or the biomass of fish. Maintaining the ecological functions and ecosystem services of reefs, even as
the species composition of the recent past becomes unattainable, will
require a new focus that both builds on the current ecosystem-based
model of management75–77 and recognizes more explicitly that ecosystems, and the people who depend on them, are changing rapidly. The
emerging resilience-based approach10,32,40,78,79 is a step forward because
it acknowledges the importance of ecological processes and the role
of human drivers. In practical terms, process-based reef management
could include reduction of corallivory (predation on corals) by the targeted culling of corallivores, enhancement of herbivory through the
regulation of specific fisheries, or management of the connectivity of
harvested functional groups by enhancing spillover from protected
areas. A focus on processes, ecological functions, ecosystem services
and human drivers therefore opens many more possibilities for active
management interventions.
Manipulating ecosystems
A radical step, which is yet to be widely applied to coral reefs, entails a
shift from passive ecosystem management to active ecosystem intervention55,80. Conventionally, the management of coral reefs has been mostly
passive, relying on an implicit assumption that if reefs are protected
from human impacts, they will return to their original condition following a disturbance. In the Anthropocene, however, this fundamental
assumption is void, and management and governance frameworks need
to specifically embrace changes in the species composition of ecosystems or they will fail. So far, attempts at active intervention such as
propagating coral fragments, assisted migration and selective breeding
of corals81,82 have had limited success and are prohibitively expensive
at meaningful spatial scales83. For example, the US National Marine
Fisheries Service estimates that a recovery plan for two species of the
coral Acropora in the Caribbean territories of the United States would
cost a minimum of US$255 million and take more than 400 years to
implement84. Therefore, finding scalable, enduring and cost-effective
interventions is an important and urgent research challenge. Efforts
have typically focused on restoring populations of depleted species such
as turtles or targeted corals, often without adequately addressing the
drivers that caused their decline in the first place. A broader approach
that seeks to reduce multiple pressures and repair key processes, including herbivory and larval recruitment, remains mostly unexplored.
Building institutions for governance
Multiscale governance is often fragmented and ineffective, and is challenged by issues of jurisdiction and legitimacy, complexity, scale and
funding85–87. More effective institutions for global governance could
facilitate the reduction of important drivers (for example, the burning
of fossil fuels or the trade in functionally important species) by assessing
the scientific evidence, setting an agenda for action, managing compliance, building capacity and influencing social norms. Previous worldwide and transnational successes, including efforts to address ozone
depletion and acid rain, demonstrate that it is feasible to meet the challenge of tackling global issues such as climate change66. Further development of international agencies for the global stewardship of threatened
ecosystems such as coral reefs could also expedite decision-making and
action at national and local levels88,89.
Fostering innovative partnerships
Local, national and transnational partnerships that involve civil society, development organizations and businesses can complement more

Changing social norms
Governments, non-governmental organizations and social movements
can actively encourage changes in social norms that lead to improved
environmental behaviours66,91. These changes can be promoted, for
instance, through the imposition of taxes, the provision of incentives
and subsidies, education and communication strategies92. Examples
include communicating the risks and costs of environmental loss, education programmes that promote the value of marine parks and nofishing zones, and providing subsidies to support the transition from
fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The future for coral reefs

Confronting the global coral reef crisis will require immediate action
to address the emission of greenhouse gasses, as well as a clearer understanding of multiple drivers and ecosystem responses in the context
of new, more realistic, scenarios of global climate change. We need
to improve our grasp of the trajectories of interacting drivers and the
responses of coral reefs to probable scenarios of shallow water temperatures and ocean pH. We should also incorporate the social sciences
into our understanding of the dynamics of linked social–ecological systems. Anthropogenic drivers are becoming stronger and more diverse,
as well as shifting in scale from local to global. Through globalization,
coral reefs are becoming more accessible, which creates a variety of
incentives for their exploitation but also has the potential to offers new
solutions on the basis of multiscale governance, including international
actions and policies. The challenge for the future is to steer away from
the tipping points (Fig. 4) that are already manifesting at local scales13,93.
Future coral reef science should be re-oriented to test the effectiveness of
policy and management solutions, to measure the success and failure of
governance approaches and to modify them accordingly, and to guide
the development of new policies94.
We should not give up hope for the persistence of Earth’s coral reefs.
Importantly, governance approaches will need to integrate knowledge
of human psychology and risk perception in ways that convey the seriousness of the challenges without generating hopelessness or despair.
Progress in coral reef governance will require effective, multilevel institutions to coordinate and support action across multiple scales. Action
to rein in distal drivers is needed at the global scale, yet there are few
central authorities that operate effectively at such a scale85. The Paris
agreement14 is already reframing the possible futures of Earth’s coral
reefs and the science that underpins their management. To steer coral
reefs through the next century, we will need to be bold, to embrace
change and to recognize that securing essential services from coral reefs
will require a new approach to science, management and governance. ■

formal governance organizations72,90. For example, the Coral Triangle
Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security is a partnership of three major environmental non-government organizations
(Conservation International, the World Wide Fund for Nature and
The Nature Conservancy) and six national governments (Indonesia,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands
and Timor-Leste), which is aiming to achieve food security, sustainable
fisheries and coral reef conservation at a regional scale68. At the local
scale, partnerships that build new alliances can also open up avenues
for improving the governance and management of reefs, even in the
absence of formal national governance67,74.
