In an effort to deliver better outcomes for people and the ecosystems they depend on, many governments and civil society
groups are engaging natural resource users in collaborative management arrangements (frequently called comanagement). However, there are few empirical studies demonstrating the social and
institutional conditions conducive to successful comanagement
outcomes, especially in small-scale ﬁsheries. Here, we evaluate 42
comanagement arrangements across ﬁve countries and show that:
(i) comanagement is largely successful at meeting social and ecological goals; (ii) comanagement tends to beneﬁt wealthier resource
users; (iii) resource overexploitation is most strongly inﬂuenced by
market access and users’ dependence on resources; and (iv) institutional characteristics strongly inﬂuence livelihood and compliance
outcomes, yet have little effect on ecological conditions.

he perceived failure of many open-access and top-down government approaches to managing common-pool resources has
inspired a shift in governance toward community-based comanagement arrangements that provide local people with a greater
say in the allocation and use of their resources (1). Comanagement is thought to help make resource management initiatives
more legitimate in the eyes of stakeholders and more reﬂective of
local conditions, creating better incentives for people to comply
with rules on their own accord (2, 3). In the context of small-scale
ﬁsheries, which support the livelihoods of some 200 million people,
comanagement arrangements can be successful at sustaining
resources and improving livelihoods of resource users (Fig. 1) (1, 4,
5). However, comanagement can also create new incentives for
overexploitation, exacerbate existing social inequalities, and lead to
other undesirable social and ecological outcomes (3, 6–9). Critical
questions remain about what communities, donors, and policymakers can do to promote desirable comanagement outcomes.
Contextual conditions such as poverty, dependence on resources, and access to markets inﬂuence whether people successfully
manage or overexploit common-pool resources (10–12). In addition, speciﬁc institutional characteristics, known as design principles, are thought to increase the likelihood of sustained collective
action by creating conditions that encourage users to cooperate
with common property institutions (10). These principles include
graduated sanctions (punishments that increase with the frequency and severity of infringements), clearly deﬁned boundaries,
collective choice rules (where users can participate in decisionmaking processes to change rules), and conﬂict resolution mechanisms, among others (10, 13, 14). To date, previous empirical
studies have not tended to evaluate the potential role of speciﬁc
institutional designs in achieving successful comanagement outcomes (15).
Here, we examine how social and ecological outcomes are
related to key institutional design and socioeconomic covariates

in 42 coral reef ﬁshery comanagement arrangements across Kenya,
Tanzania, Madagascar, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea (Fig. 2
and SI Appendix, Table S1). We used Ostrom’s diagnostic framework for analyzing social-ecological systems (4, 11, 16) to guide
our study design (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1). Using a
combination of underwater visual census of reef ﬁshes and
semistructured interviews with >1,000 resource users and local
leaders (SI Appendix), we quantiﬁed the relative importance of
household and community-scale factors inﬂuencing three independent comanagement outcomes. These outcomes were as
follows: (i) perceived impacts of comanagement on livelihoods of
resource users; (ii) reported compliance with restrictions; and (iii)
the exploitation status of ﬁshery resources (SI Appendix).
Results and Discussion
Comanaged ﬁsheries generally perform well on all three measures
of success. In particular, 54% of resource users perceived beneﬁcial
outcomes for their livelihoods; 88% reported that comanagement
arrangements were mostly or fully complied with; and comanaged
ﬁsheries generally maintained a greater standing ﬁsh biomass than
ﬁshed areas lacking local management (but, as expected, both were
considerably more exploited than most no-take ﬁsheries closures in
the same countries; Fig. 3 and SI Appendix). Our results are, however, not uniformly positive: There are cases where comanagement
has not achieved positive social or ecological outcomes. Determining how these poorly performing comanagement systems
can be improved requires a better understanding of how speciﬁc
social and ecological outcomes are associated with particular institutional and contextual conditions (11) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
We used a series of Bayesian-hierarchical models to quantify
relationships between the probability of successful comanagement
outcomes and the 22 household and community-scale covariates
(Fig. 4). For our metric of perceived livelihood impacts, we used
separate estimates to identify differences between the self-identiﬁed losers and winners resulting from comanagement (Fig. 4 A and
B). The most successful comanagement arrangements for the
livelihoods of users occur when key institutional designs are in
place; when knowledge about the role humans play in ecosystem
decline is high; where people have long been involved in comanagement; and when they are wealthier (Fig. 4 A and B and SI

Fig. 1. (A) Coral reefs support small-scale ﬁsheries in many low-income, tropical nations. As with many other types of common-pool resources, reef ﬁsheries
are often overexploited when effective institutions are not in place (10). (B) The complex and multispecies nature of small-scale reef ﬁsheries, illustrated by
this harvest from Indonesia, makes them particularly difﬁcult to effectively manage solely through top-down regulations, especially in the resource-deﬁcient
context in which many tropical national ﬁsheries agencies operate (1). (C) Comanagement arrangements that allow resource users to develop and enforce
locally appropriate rules about resource use, such as this periodically harvested ﬁsheries closure from Papua New Guinea, can provide substantial beneﬁts to
resource users, achieve high levels of compliance, and potentially lead toward more sustainable ﬁsheries (24, 41). Photos by J.E.C.

Appendix). This latter result suggests that despite the strong potential for positive social and ecological outcomes, comanagement
can contribute to social inequity by creating opportunities for local
elites to control resources (6, 7, 17). By providing users with
a greater say in the allocation of resources, comanagement is likely
to involve a redistribution of access rights (18), and the wealthy
may be better poised to take advantage of these changes (17, 19).
There is no evidence, however, that comanagement is detrimental
to the livelihoods of the poor (Fig. 4B), who are often marginalized
in other types of governance regimes in regards to resource allocation and entitlements (19, 20). To ensure that comanagement

arrangements attain the levels of perceived equity and legitimacy
necessary for long-term success (3, 21), managers must ﬁnd ways to
deliver beneﬁcial livelihood outcomes to the poor. Delivering
these outcomes will require an equitable distribution of power (6,

Fig. 3. Comparison of standing biomass in no-take ﬁsheries closures, comanaged ﬁsheries, and sites with no local management. Levels of ﬁsh biomass are
demonstrably higher in comanaged areas {350 [265, 450] kg/ha; highest posterior density (HPD) [95% uncertainty intervals (UI)], n = 27} than in comparable
open-access reef ﬁsheries (177 [116, 261] kg/ha, n = 26), but no-take ﬁshery
closures have the highest expected biomass (619 [417, 818] kg/ha, n = 16). HPD
and 95% UI are based on a (normal) Bayesian linear random-effects model for
log(biomass) given management status. Biomass data for no-take ﬁshery closures and sites with no-local management are from parallel studies on the
ecological outcomes of different coral reef management strategies in our study
countries (refs. 24 and 40 and SI Appendix).

22) and, in some cases, may involve poverty reduction strategies,
such as the provision of microcredit loans (23).
Compliance is a continual challenge for many ﬁsheries management and marine conservation initiatives (21, 24). Institutional
design principles are thought to create conditions conducive to
cooperation in common property scenarios (10), and we found
that high levels of reported compliance are positively related to
graduated sanctions (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix). There is also
moderate evidence that reported compliance is higher when comanagement arrangements are further from markets, where
respondents are wealthier, and where they trust their leaders and
other community members (Fig. 4C). There are frequent calls to
establish territorial use rights that provide local resource users
with exclusive rights to their ﬁshing grounds (4), but we found that
in a developing country comanagement context, compliance was
lowest under this type of restricted access arrangement (Fig. 4C).
Interviews with resource users revealed plausible explanations for
this seemingly counterintuitive result: (i) Several key informants
and respondents noted that membership (i.e., who had access
rights) became difﬁcult to clearly deﬁne because of marriage
arrangements between members and nonmembers. In the context
of many of our study sites, access rights were determined by afﬁliation with speciﬁc social groupings (e.g., community or clan), as
opposed to a formal licensing arrangement. Interestingly, we did
not ﬁnd that “clearly deﬁned membership” (one of the institutional design principles) had a consistent effect on compliance throughout the 42 sites, but respondents suggest that
confusion about membership may play an important role in some
local contexts; and (ii) Communities often lacked patrol boats or
systems of offshore surveillance to effectively enforce these types
of access rights. A number of users noted that by the time they
paddled or sailed out to enforce the access rights, infringers with
motorized boats had left. In addition to adequate enforcement
capacity, comanagement compliance is also about creating conditions that are conducive to people cooperating (10, 21). Managers and donors can help build the legitimacy, social capital, and
trust that foster cooperation by making targeted investments that

lead toward transparent and deliberative comanagement systems
(1, 3, 21, 22, 25).
The state of reef ﬁshery resources is often assumed to be primarily driven by Malthusian overﬁshing related to the size of
nearby human settlements (e.g., refs. 26 and 27). However, a key
ﬁnding from this study is that the exploitation status of comanaged ﬁsheries is most strongly affected by access to markets and
levels of dependence on marine resources (Fig. 4D), providing
potential levers for policy action. Strategies that address the
complex linkages between ecosystems, local livelihoods, and
market access will be critical for sustainable ﬁsheries comanagement (14, 28, 29). These strategies may include, for example, livelihoods-focused approaches to poverty reduction (28)
and improved market governance through sustainable harvesting
certiﬁcations (29, 30).
This study models the inﬂuence of a range of institutional design principles on common property outcomes using primary data
across large geographic and social scales. A surprising ﬁnding is
that these institutional characteristics thought to inﬂuence the
sustainability of commons governance are strongly related to social, but not ecological, outcomes in the comanagement of smallscale ﬁsheries (Fig. 4). Critically, these design principles may help
people organize effectively and perceive beneﬁts from collective
action (10), but they do not ensure that a given organization will
sustainably manage resources. Indeed, people may collectively
organize to exploit resources rather than to sustain them (9).
Consequently, organizing collective action for sustainability rather
than short-term exploitation may require an adaptive comanagement approach (31–33) that: (i) fosters learning about the
social-ecological system (34), (ii) incorporates local and scientiﬁc
knowledge systems (35), (iii) creates incentives for ecosystem
stewardship (36), and (iv) invests in multiscale governance
arrangements that network comanagement organizations and
foster key linkages with higher levels of social and political organization (10, 37).
Our study provides empirical evidence that comanagement
can help to sustain ﬁsheries and the people that depend on them,

for respondents that perceived positive and detrimental livelihood outcomes from comanagement. Responses include the following: perceived beneﬁcial

Response estimates are standardized to be directly comparable within each column and include both household and community-level covariates, modeled at

even in the social-ecological contexts most susceptible to failure:
artisanal, multispecies, coastal ﬁsheries in low-income countries
(1). However, the likelihood of this happening is higher when
certain social, economic, and institutional conditions are in place.
Managers and donors can facilitate desirable comanagement
outcomes by working with resource users on context-dependent
strategies to improve livelihoods and governance, such as
dampening the negative inﬂuence of global markets, providing
equitable livelihood beneﬁts, and strengthening local institutions
(10, 29, 38). These policy actions will be a substantial departure
from the norms of many ﬁsheries managers, and implementing
them effectively will require forging partnerships with social
scientists, donors, ﬁnancial institutions, and civil society (39).

other stakeholders), underwater visual census, and analyses of secondary
sources such as population censuses (SI Appendix, Table S1). In total, we
conducted 960 resource user interviews, 53 key informant interviews, 54
community leader interviews, and 51 organizational leader interviews. Our
data collection provided information on three dependent variables (perceived impact of comanagement on the livelihoods of users; perceived
levels of compliance, and reef ﬁsh biomass); and 22 covariate attributes
relating to the local governance system, the social, economic, and political
setting, and the socioeconomic characteristics of resource users in each
community (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1). Additionally, ﬁsh biomass
data from comanaged sites were compared with 26 sites without local-level
management and 16 no-take ﬁshery closures in our study countries (SI
Appendix). We used Ostrom’s diagnostic framework (11, 40) to build a series of Bayesian hierarchical models that quantify the relationship between
our 22 measured covariates and three dimensions of comanagement success (SI Appendix, Table S3).

We studied 42 independent comanagement arrangements spanning ﬁve
