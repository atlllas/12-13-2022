Economic Trends in Global Marine Fisheries
ROLF WILLMANN
KIERAN KELLEHER

The focus on the declining biological health of
the world’s ﬁsheries has tended to obscure the even
more critical deterioration of the economic health
of the ﬁsheries, which stems from poor governance
that is both a cause and a result of the biological
overexploitation. Economically healthy ﬁsheries
are fundamental to achieving accepted goals for the
ﬁsheries sector, such as improved livelihoods, food
security, increased exports, and the restoration of
ﬁsh stocks—a key objective of the Plan of Implementation endorsed by the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Anonymous 2002).
This chapter reviews the salient trends in the
world’s ﬁsheries with a focus on productivity and
economic performance indicators and makes the
case for comprehensive reform of ﬁsheries governance to capture the large net economic beneﬁts
that currently are lost. It complements ecological
and conservation arguments further emphasizing
the urgency to improve the management of the
world’s capture ﬁsheries.

2.1. INTRODUCTION
Fisheries are an underperforming global asset.
A recent study by the World Bank and Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(World Bank and FAO 2009) indicates that the difference between the potential and actual net economic beneﬁts from marine ﬁsheries is on the order
of $50 billion (109) per year. Improved governance
of marine ﬁsheries could capture a substantial part
of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Reform of
the ﬁsheries sector could generate considerable additional economic growth and alternative livelihoods,
both in the marine economy and in other sectors.
Long before the fuel price increases of 2008, the
economic health of the world’s marine ﬁsheries has
been in decline. The buildup of redundant ﬁshing ﬂeet
capacity, deployment of increasingly powerful ﬁshing
technologies, and increasing pollution and habitat
loss have depleted ﬁsh stocks worldwide. Despite
the increased ﬁshing effort, the global marine catch
has been stagnant for more than a decade, while the
natural ﬁsh capital—the wealth of the oceans—has
declined. At the same time, the margin between the
global costs of catching and the value of the catch has
narrowed. In many cases the catching operations are
buoyed up by subsidies, so the global ﬁshery economy to the point of landing (the harvest subsector) is
in deﬁcit. The cumulative economic loss to the global
economy over the last three decades is estimated to
be on the order of 2 trillion dollars.

2.2. OVERVIEW
2.2.1. The Deteriorating State of
the Marine Fishery Resources
The crisis in marine ﬁsheries has been well documented in biological terms. One-half of the
marine capture ﬁsh stocks monitored by the FAO
20

Economic Trends in Global Marine Fisheries
are designated as fully exploited, producing at or
close to their maximum sustainable yield. Another
25 percent of the marine ﬁsh stocks are overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion and
are yielding less than their maximum sustainable
yield (FAO 2007a). The remaining 25 percent of
the marine capture ﬁsh stocks are underexploited
or moderately exploited, and while this implies that
more could be produced, many of these underexploited stocks are of low-value species or species
for which harvesting may be uneconomical. Global
production of seafood from wild stocks is at or
close to its long-run biological maximum level.
Globally, the proportion of fully exploited and
overexploited, depleted, or recovering ﬁsh stocks
has continued to increase from just above 50 percent of all assessed ﬁsh stocks in the mid-1970s to
about 75 percent in 2005 (FAO 2006). This indicates that, in economic terms, more than 75 percent
of the world’s ﬁsheries are underperforming, or
subject to economic overﬁshing. In 1974, about 40
percent of the assessed stocks were rated as underexploited or moderately exploited. By 2005 this
percentage had fallen to 25 percent (FAO 2007a).
Figure 2.1 indicates that the reported global
marine catch has stagnated at a level of 80–85 million tons since 1990. This stagnation hides several
underlying trends in the composition of the catch as
described below.
Between 1950 and 1970, the recorded catch of
both the demersal species (bottom-dwelling) and
pelagic species (species that live in the upper layers of the sea) grew considerably (ﬁgure 2.2). Since

1970, demersal ﬁsh catches have stabilized around
20 million tons, while pelagic catches grew to a
peak volume of almost 44 million tons in 1994.
Since then, pelagic catches have ﬂuctuated between
36 and 41 million tons.
Thus, the global ﬁsh supply from marine capture ﬁsheries increasingly relies on lower value
species characterized by large ﬂuctuations in yearto-year productivity, concealing the slow degradation of the demersal high-value resources (FAO
2007a). This change in the species composition of
the catch is commonly referred to as “ﬁshing down
marine food webs” (Pauly et al. 1998). The stagnant level of production is thus maintained by the
relatively higher growth rate of a higher proportion
of smaller ﬁsh species lower on the food web and a
likely decrease in the average age of the catch, both
of which maintain ﬁsh biomass. In some ﬁsheries,
the targets of ﬁshing have also expanded to cover
an entire spectrum of species in the ecosystem, or
“ﬁshing through the food webs” (Essington et al.
2006).
The changing patterns of discards (unwanted
ﬁsh caught and dumped at sea) also suggests that
the global catch now comprises substantial quantities of lower value, previously discarded ﬁsh, as
the amount of ﬁsh discarded may have decreased
by more than 10 million tons between 1994 and
2004 (Kelleher 2005). For example, the quantity of so-called “trash ﬁsh” used for aquaculture
feed is estimated to be 5 million to 7 million tons
(Tacon 2006). There is also growing evidence that
the biomass of large predatory ﬁshes has declined

substantially from preindustrialized levels in many
regions (Ahrens and Walters 2005; Myers and
Worm 2003), although this may not hold true for
all ﬁsheries (Sibert et al. 2006).
Climatic variability has always been a signiﬁcant
determinant of ﬁsh stock growth and decline, and
response to climate variability is part of the daily
business of ﬁshing. However, climate change, as
described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007),
is placing additional stress on already stressed

ﬁsheries. While recent studies on coral reefs (Baird
et al. 2007) and reviews of impacts in the North
Atlantic provide important guidance on trends, the
impact of changes in sea temperature and ocean
acidity on ﬁsh stocks remain largely undetermined
at the level of developing countries. Similarly, the
impact of sea-level rise and erratic climatic events
on the community and household wealth of coastal
ﬁshing populations remains largely uncalculated.
These additional ecological, environmental, and
economic stresses caused by climate change add to

2.2.2. Proﬁle and Trends in Global
Fisheries Production
In 2006, total reported world ﬁshery production1
reached almost 160 million tons (ﬁgure 2.3), of
which 53 percent originates from marine capture
ﬁsheries. Over the last twenty years the continued
growth in world ﬁsh production is largely attributable to aquaculture (ﬁgure 2.3). China is the largest

producer, contributing 49 million tons in 2005, of
which 32 million tons are from aquaculture (ﬁgure
2.4). Developing countries have contributed more
than one-half of total capture ﬁsh production since
1990 (ﬁgure 2.5). This share has reached more than
two-thirds in 2005, a development largely driven
by Asian aquaculture production.

2.2.3. Trade and Fish
Consumption
Rising demand for ﬁsh has been a major driver of
increased ﬁshing effort. Spurred by the globalization of markets for ﬁsh, some 37 percent of global
ﬁsh production is traded internationally, making
ﬁsh one of the most traded “agricultural” commodities and accounting for up to 13 percent of global
“agricultural trade.” The beneﬁts of increasing
globalization in ﬁsh trade have nevertheless been
reduced by growing overexploitation, as ineffective
governance of ﬁsheries allowed the depletion of ﬁsh
stocks—the natural capital, or ﬁsh wealth.
In 2006, total world trade of ﬁsh and ﬁshery
products reached a record value of $86.4 billion
(export value), more than a tenfold increase since
1976, when global ﬁsh trade statistics ﬁrst became
available. The share of developing countries in total
ﬁshery exports was 48 percent by value and 57 percent by quantity. Growth in aquaculture production

has been an important factor for the global expansion of seafood trade.
The growth in reported global ﬁsh production
has more than kept pace with population growth
(ﬁgure 2.6). Based on the reported global ﬁsh
production, the total amount of ﬁsh available for
human consumption in 2005 is estimated to have
reached 107 million tons, thereby providing an
average global per capita ﬁsh supply of 16.5 kg, but
with large differences across regions and countries
as well as within countries (FAO 2007a). These
global values may not, however, capture important
local subsistence ﬁsh consumption.
Rising demand in Asia—especially in China—
and in Europe has largely driven the increase in
average global per capita ﬁsh consumption (ﬁgure
2.7). This global increase was particularly pronounced in the 1980s and 1990s but has stabilized
at around 16 kg/capita per year (FAO 2007b).
Per capita consumption of ﬁsh in South America
is stabilizing after a peak in 1995. Per capita consumption in Africa and South America remains
low (ﬁgure 2.7). In both regions, but especially in
sub-Saharan Africa, low animal-protein intake is
believed to be a result of low per capita incomes.
Traditionally, low-value ﬁsh and ﬁshery products
provide cheap protein to the poorer populations
in these regions as well as in Asia. The increased

2.2.4. The Economic Performance
of World Marine Capture Fisheries
2.2.4.1. Value of Production and
Global Fish Prices
The economic performance of global marine capture ﬁsheries is determined by the quantity of ﬁsh
caught, the price of ﬁsh, the harvesting costs, and
the productivity of the ﬁsheries. In 2004, the total
value of reported global ﬁsh production was estimated at $148 billion at the point of ﬁrst sale.
Capture ﬁsheries was $85 billion and aquaculture
was $63 billion. The total estimated value of the
reported marine catch of 85.7 million tons was
$78.8 billion2 (FAO 2007a).
The average ex-vessel price (or price at ﬁrst sale)
was $918 per metric ton for the reported marine
catch and $666 per ton for the reported inland
(freshwater) catch. The average farm gate price (or
price at ﬁrst sale) for cultured ﬁsh was $1,393 per
ton. The higher unit price for aquaculture products
is due to the production of high-value species (e.g.,
shrimp and salmon). The ex-vessel prices are considered to be conservative and close to true market
prices, being relatively free of taxes, subsidies, and
other market distorting inﬂuences.
Global ﬁsh price data sets are relatively incomplete at the global level: the only available long-term

price data series is the ﬁsh export unit value derived
from trade statistics from the FAO’s FishStat database (ﬁgure 2.8). The unit value of exports may
underestimate the global trend in real ﬁsh prices.
On one hand, higher value ﬁsh products tend to
be exported. On the other hand, aquaculture has
a growing share in world ﬁsh trade, and prices of
many cultured species have tended to decline from
the initial elevated price levels.
Because of the changing product composition of
exports, the above values are indicative only of the
price trends, but nevertheless show several interesting features (ﬁgure 2.8). There was a signiﬁcant
decline in ﬁsh prices between 1978 and 1985, followed by a strong price rise from the mid-1980s to
the early 1990s, a gradual decline until 2001 and a
recovery in prices during the most recent years. The
real unit value of exports in 2004 was no higher
than in the late 1980s. This strongly suggests that
the global price of ﬁsh in 2004 was not signiﬁcantly
different from that in the late 1980s.
Setting aside numerous supply-driven ﬂuctuations, until late 2007, the real prices of many
ﬁsh commodities have seen little change since
2004 (Josupeit 2008). Fillet and product yields
improved, wastage reduced, and supply chains
shortened, making downstream industry increasingly more efﬁcient. Tuna and some whiteﬁsh

Overview

prices have increased while supplies from aquaculture have dampened prices. The notable exceptions
are increased ﬁsh meal and ﬁsh oil prices driven by
higher demand for meat and aquaculture products.
Thus, while the unit value of the aggregate
reported catch has remained relatively constant, the
higher proportion of relatively lower value “trash
ﬁsh” and small pelagic species is buoyed up by
the increasing scarcity value of species higher on the
food web, for example, lobster or grouper. The scarcity of some higher value species has created opportunities to ﬁsh in deeper waters, often at a higher cost
per unit of catch and also at a cost to the relatively
unknown biodiversity of the continental slopes.
Growth in demand for ﬁsh is concentrated in
developing countries, where populations and per
capita incomes show strong growth. However,
survey data from China in the period 1980–2000
indicate only slight real ﬁsh price increases (Delgado et al. 2003). Recent studies show substantial
increases in Chinese seafood consumption with
increases of more than 100 percent in lower income
households and more than 150 percent for higher
income families between 1998 and 2005 (Chenjun
2007). Demand has continued to grow in the United
States, and real prices of fresh ﬁsh show a long-term
increasing trend, while the price of the traditional
frozen products and particularly canned products
has declined during the last 30 years (ﬁgure 2.9).
However, more recently, the economic downturn

weakening U.S. dollar exchange rate and consumer
spending may be contributing to a decline in U.S.
shrimp imports, a key seafood indicator (Seafood
International 2008).

2.2.4.2. Cost Trends in Global
Marine Capture Fisheries
No global data set is available on the costs of ﬁshing.
However, costs and earnings studies are available
from a number of countries and ﬁsheries. Fishing
costs vary greatly by type of ﬁshery and locality; for
example, many smaller vessels are nonmotorized.
In general, the major cost factors, as percentage of
total costs, for most ﬁsheries are as follows:
Labor
30–50%
Fuel
10–25%
Fishing gear
5–15%
Repair and maintenance
5–10%
Capital cost, such as
depreciation and interest 5–25%
The trends in the costs of each of these factors of
production are of relevance not only for an understanding of the historical trends in ﬁsheries but also
to provide a basis for future projections, for example, the effect of rising fuel prices. Cost data must
be treated with some caution because the true cost
data tend to be confounded by taxes and subsidies.

2.2.4.3. Fuel Prices and
Productivity
The cost of crude oil not only directly relates to fuel
costs but also indirectly affects the cost of ﬁshing
nets and lines and the cost of vessel construction
and repair. Figure 2.10 shows an index of the real
price of crude oil and an index of the real material costs in U.S. shipbuilding. For comparison
purposes, the index of the real unit value of ﬁsh
exports is also illustrated. It shows that until about
mid-1980 real unit export value rose faster than
crude oil and unit material costs, and since the late
1980s price and cost trends were fairly similar but
with the crude oil price depicting a steeply rising
trend since 2000.
Since 2000, fuel subsidies have probably played
an important role in supporting the ﬁnancial viability of ﬁshing operations in some countries. Such
fuel subsidies (mostly foregone taxes) to the ﬁshing
sector by governments globally are estimated to be
in the range of $4.2 billion to $8.5 billion per year
(Sumaila et al. 2008).
In the absence of productivity gains, ﬁgure 2.10
strongly suggests that the economic performance of
global marine ﬁsheries is unlikely to have improved
since the early 1990s. Several factors continue to

undermine productivity and proﬁtability. These
include rising oil prices; rising costs of ﬁshing gear
and vessels, often compounded by unfavorable
exchange rates; an increasing regulatory burden;
and depletion of inshore stocks causing ﬁshers to
travel farther to ﬁshing grounds.
On the other hand, motorized ﬁsheries; ﬁsheries that use passive gear (such as traps), which use
relatively less fuel; and ﬁsheries with ready access to
export markets, may have seen an improvement in
proﬁtability in this period. Technology has also driven
productivity gains. Using sophisticated ﬁsh ﬁnding
equipment tuna purse seiners in the Indian Ocean can
now harvest three times the annual catch of seiners
operating in the mid-1980s. New designs of trawls
reduce the engine power and fuel consumption by 33
percent or more (Richard and Tait 1997). Electronic
sale of ﬁsh while vessels are still at sea is reducing
transaction costs, helps prevent loss of product quality
and value and makes markets more efﬁcient (Jensen
2007). However, as these innovations are adopted
throughout a ﬂeet, then productivity falls and the
intramarginal rents generated are not maintained.
Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that at
the global level productivity has further deteriorated, especially in recent years, as the majority

of producers incur higher ﬁshing costs while the
global catch has remained stagnant.
At the global level, on average, each ton of ﬁsh
landed required nearly half a ton of fuel. In value
terms, production of a ton of ﬁsh worth $918
required $282 worth of fuel, or 31 percent of the
output value in 2004. There is considerable variation
in fuel consumption across different ﬁshing methods,
types of ﬁsheries, and fuel efﬁciency of engines. The

addressed in section 2.2.5.3, and the overall trend in

activities, and a high proportion of these workers
are women. Many countries do not separate capture
ﬁsheries and aquaculture employment data. Based
on available ﬁsheries labor statistics, the number
of capture ﬁshers accounted for three-quarters of
global employment in ﬁsheries.
While employment in capture ﬁsheries has been
growing steadily in most low- and middle-income
countries, ﬁsheries employment in most industrialized economies has been declining. This decline
can be attributed to several factors, including the

During the past three decades, the number of ﬁshers
and ﬁsh farmers has grown at a higher rate than the
world’s population growth rate (ﬁgure 2.12). Fishing and ﬁsh farming activities provided livelihoods
to an estimated 41 million people in 2004, working either on a part-time or full-time basis. Applying an assumed ratio of 1:3 for direct employment
(production) and secondary activities (postharvest

relatively low remuneration in relation to often
high-risk and difﬁcult working conditions, growing investment in labor-saving onboard equipment
(FAO 2007a), and a failure to attract younger workers. Increased ﬁsh production is not the only cause
of the increase in the number of ﬁshery workers in
developing countries. For some communities, ﬁshing is a growing poverty trap and, in the absence of
alternatives, a livelihood of last resort.
Asia has by far the highest share and growth
rate in the number of ﬁshers and ﬁsh farmers (ﬁgure
2.13). In this region, the number of ﬁshers increased
threefold over the three decades from 1970 to 2000,
reﬂecting both a strong increase in part-time and
occasional employment in capture ﬁsheries and the
growth in aquaculture activities. In Africa, growth
was more moderate until 1990 but has accelerated
sharply since then.

An indicator of labor productivity is the output per
person measured either in physical or in value terms.
Figure 2.14 shows the average output per ﬁsher valued at average ex-vessel prices in 1998–2000. Average output per ﬁsher ranged from a high of just above
$19,000 in Europe to about $2,231 in Africa and
$1,720 in Asia, about a tenfold difference.
The low labor productivity in Africa and Asia
reﬂects low ﬁshing incomes in most countries in
these regions. Average labor productivity is higher
when only full-time ﬁshers are considered, but it
would still be signiﬁcantly below labor productivity
ﬁgures in other primary sectors of the economies.
For example, the estimated average gross revenue
per full time ﬁsher in India’s marine ﬁsheries was
$3,400 in 2004. The ﬁgure for small-scale ﬁshers
was $1,870 and for ﬁshers on industrial vessels was
$5,490 (Kurien 2007).

Overview

metric tons per fisher per year

There is both hard and anecdotal evidence of low
levels of crew remunerations in many of the world’s
marine ﬁsheries. For example, Vietnamese workers
on third-country ﬁshing vessels operating in South
African waters receive a monthly pay of $150 to
$180, and working conditions include 16–18 hour
workdays. A signiﬁcant share of crews on Thai
industrial ﬁshing vessels are from Myanmar and
Cambodia, two countries with widespread poverty
and average incomes some eight times lower than
those of Thailand. Based on average country poverty data, some 5.8 million, or 20 percent of the
world’s 29 million ﬁshers, may be small-scale ﬁshers earning less than $1 a day (FAO 2004).
The strong growth in capture ﬁsheries employment (i.e., ﬁshers operating full time, part time,
occasionally, or with unspeciﬁed status) has not
resulted in a commensurate increase in recorded
inland and marine capture ﬁsheries production. As
shown in ﬁgure 2.15, the average harvest per capture ﬁsher has declined by 42 percent from more
than 5 tons annually in 1970 to only 3.1 tons in
2000.
The signiﬁcance of this decline in average output
per ﬁsher has to be seen in the context of the enormous technological developments that have taken
place in the world’s capture ﬁsheries during this
period, including large-scale motorization of traditional small-scale ﬁsheries; the expansion of active
ﬁshing techniques such as trawling and purse seining; the introduction of increasingly sophisticated
ﬁshing-ﬁnding and navigation equipment; and the
growing use of modern means of communication.
While this technological progress has increased

5.5

labor productivity in some ﬁsheries, in aggregate at
the global level, the resource constraint, in combination with the prevailing open access condition,
has prevented an increase in average labor productivity in the world’s capture ﬁsheries. On the
contrary, productivity has signiﬁcantly declined, a
decline caused by a shrinking resource base and a
growing number of ﬁshers.
Because the number of ﬁshing vessels has also
grown greatly during this period, as we show further below, at the global level the productivityenhancing investments in capture ﬁsheries have
on average yielded small returns and have stymied
growth in labor productivity and incomes in the
sector.

2.2.5. Fishing Effort and Fishing
Fleets
Fishing effort is a composite indicator of ﬁshing
activity. It includes the number, type, and power of
ﬁshing vessels and the type and amount of ﬁshing
gear. It captures the contribution of navigation and
ﬁsh ﬁnding equipment, as well as the skill of the
skipper and ﬁshing crew. Effective effort is difﬁcult to quantify even in a single ﬁshery, and there is
considerable uncertainty about the current level of
global ﬁshing effort. Given the multiple dimensions
of ﬁshing effort, it is understandable that there are
no global statistics available.
The primary factor inﬂuencing ﬁshing effort is
the size of the global ﬁshing ﬂeet as characterized
in terms of vessel numbers, tonnage, and engine
power and type of ﬁshing gear as described in the
following section. In biological terms, ﬁshing effort
equates to ﬁshing mortality. The functional relationship is determined by the catchability coefﬁcient. This coefﬁcient is a measure of both the level
of harvesting technology and ﬁshing skill and the
relative ease of harvesting the ﬁsh stock in terms of
its distribution and abundance.

large ﬁshing vessels has continued to increase. Asia
accounts by far for the highest number of vessels,
both decked and undecked.
FAO data on national ﬁshing ﬂeets is derived
primarily from administrative records, which may
not always be current. For example, national ﬁshing vessel records may include vessels that are currently not operational and frequently omit large
numbers of unregistered small-scale ﬁshing vessels
(FAO 2006). A further difﬁculty in maintaining a
consistent data set results from the change in the
measurement of vessel size from gross registered

tonnage to gross tonnage and the reﬂagging of vessels to ﬂags of convenience.
For large vessels, the Lloyd’s database of vessels (Lloyd’s Register—Fairplay 2008) provides
a relatively complete global data set for ﬁshing
vessels above 100 gross tons. However, coverage
is incomplete. While FAO ﬂeet statistics show an
increase in global ﬂeet size since the early 1990s,
the Lloyd’s Register shows a decline in the number of ﬁshing vessels larger than 100 gross tons in
recent years (ﬁgure 2.17). This divergence in trends
can be explained partly by the evolution of the Chinese ﬂeet, which is incompletely listed in the Lloyds
Register3 because it is domestically insured. For this
ﬂeet and for smaller vessels, FAO statistics are used
which have been compiled from national data. In
2002, China adopted a ﬁve-year program to reduce
its commercial ﬂeet by 30,000 vessels by 2007
(7 percent). However, the numbers of commercial
ﬁshing vessels reported to FAO in both 2003 and
2004 are greater than the number reported as being
in operation in 2002 (FAO 2007a).

2.2.5.2. Development in Fishing
Capacity and Fleet Productivity
Fishing capacity is the amount of ﬁshing effort that
can be produced in a given time by a ﬁshing vessel or ﬂeet under full utilization for a given ﬁshery
resource condition (FAO 2000).

Overview

FIGURE 2.18 Fleet productivity development (total decked vessels). (Data are
based on authors’ calculations; Garcia and Newton 1997; FAO FishStat; FAO
Fisheries and Aquaculture Information and Statistics Service)

The increase both in vessel numbers and in vessel technology has enhanced the capacity of the
global ﬂeet and facilitated access to an expanding
range of marine ﬁshery resources and more efﬁcient
use of these resources.
Fitzpatrick (1996) estimated that the technological coefﬁcient, a parameter of vessel capacity, grew at a rate of 4.3 percent per annum from
1965 to 1995.4 Assuming that this trend has continued, growth in technological efﬁciency coupled
with growth in the number of vessels suggests a
steeply rising global ﬂeet capacity. The capacity
index shown in ﬁgure 2.18 is a multiple of the
total number of decked vessels and the technological coefﬁcient.5 The trend line of the catch/
capacity index demonstrates that the global harvesting productivity has, on average, declined by
a factor of 6.
The exploitation of a growing number of marginal ﬁsh stocks partly explains this decline, but the
buildup of ﬁshing overcapacity is clearly a major
contributing factor. Thus, the gains from technological progress have generally not been realized
because the limited ﬁsh stocks call for a concomitant reduction in the number of vessels to allow for
improved vessel productivity.
The decline in physical productivity is compounded by the decreasing spread between average
harvesting costs and average ex-vessel ﬁsh prices,
causing depressed proﬁt margins and reinvestment.

While this has a dampening effect on growth in ﬂeet
capacity, depressed ﬂeet reinvestment may retard a
shift to more energy-efﬁcient harvesting technologies and a reduction in the carbon footprint of the
ﬁshing industry.
Many countries have adopted policies to limit
the growth of national ﬁshing capacity, both to
protect the aquatic resources and to make ﬁshing more economically viable for the harvesting
enterprises (FAO 2007a). This has proven difﬁcult and costly to implement in many instances,
and even where numbers of vessels have been successfully reduced (Curtis and Squires 2007), the
reduction in ﬁshing effort has been considerably
less than proportional, because the less efﬁcient
vessels tend to exit the ﬁshery and expansion
in technical efﬁciency counters the reduction in
vessel numbers.
The global ﬂeet has attempted to maintain
its proﬁtability by reducing real labor costs, by
ﬂeet modernization and by introduction of fuelefﬁcient technologies and practices, particularly in
developed countries. Vessels are also reported to
remain in harbor for increasingly longer periods
of the year, focusing harvesting on peak ﬁshing
seasons.
The receipt of government ﬁnancial support has
also assisted both vessel operators and crews, for
instance, through income compensation for crews.
Subsidies in the world’s marine ﬁsheries have
