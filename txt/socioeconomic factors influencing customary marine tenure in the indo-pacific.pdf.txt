Socioeconomic factors influencing customary marine tenure in
the Indo-Pacific
Joshua Cinner1

ABSTRACT. For generations communities in the Western Pacific have employed a range of resource
management techniques (including periodic reef closures, gear restrictions, entry limitations, and the
protection of spawning aggregations) to limit marine resource use. Localized control over marine resources,
commonly known as customary marine tenure (CMT), is the legal and cultural foundation for many of
these practices. Because of their perceived potential to meet both conservation and community goals, these
traditional resource management techniques are being revitalized by communities, governments, and NGOs
as an integral part of national and regional marine conservation plans in the Pacific. However, the viability
of conservation strategies built on a foundation of marine tenure may be in question, as it remains unclear
whether marine tenure systems will be able to withstand the profound social and economic changes sweeping
the Pacific region. Numerous studies have suggested that changes in marine tenure are attributed to social
and economic factors, however, specific relationships between socioeconomic conditions and marine tenure
are still not well understood. This paper examines the social and economic characteristics of 21 coastal
communities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and explores the characteristics of the communities that
employ exclusive marine tenure to answer the following questions: Which socioeconomic factors are related
to the presence of CMT regimes? How might socioeconomic factors influence the ability of communities
to employ or maintain CMT regimes? Distance to market, immigration, dependence on fishing, and conflicts
were found to be related to the presence of highly exclusive marine tenure systems. Exploring these
relationships will help conservation practitioners better understand how future social changes may influence
the foundation of conservation and development projects.
Key Words: customary marine tenure; common-property; socioeconomic; Papua New Guinea; Indonesia.

INTRODUCTION
Contrary to Western society's propensity toward
managing marine resources as open-access
situations, another paradigm of common ocean
governance called Customary Marine Tenure
(CMT) is prevalent in parts of the Pacific. Under
CMT, access to inshore marine resources is
generally controlled by social units including
individuals, families, clans or other kinship-based
institutions, and villages (Carrier 1987, Ward 1997).
These marine tenure institutions can range from
relatively simple communally-owned marine areas
from which outsiders are excluded to the complex
and overlapping system of individual and family
rights to space, species, gear, and even specific

techniques of using gear described by Carrier (1987)
and Cinner et al. (in press a) in the Manus province
of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Although CMT has
been documented throughout the World (Hviding
1996), it has reached the highest level of
development in the Western Pacific (Ruddle and
Akimichi 1984), including Japan (Ruddle 1985),
Melanesia (Malinowski 1935, Hviding 1983, 1996,
Wright 1985, Carrier 1987, Aswani 1999, 2002,
Cooke et al. 2000, Foale and Macintyre 2000,
Hickey and Johannes 2002), Polynesia (Hoffmann
2002), Micronesia (Johannes 1981, Zann 1985),
Indonesia (Polunin 1984, Mantjoro 1996, Ruttan
1998, Harkes and Novaczek 2002), and Australia
(Johannes and MacFarlane 1984). Legal recognition
of marine tenure regimes can vary significantly

between countries. For example, in PNG customary
ownership of marine resources is formally
recognized in the constitution (Hyndman 1993).
Alternatively, much of neighboring Indonesia is
open-access. However, in some northern and
eastern regions of Indonesia (i.e., parts of Muluku,
North Sulawesi, and West Papua provinces), de
facto marine tenure systems still govern local access
to marine resources (see Polunin 1984, Mantjoro
1996, Ruttan 1998, Harkes and Novaczek 2002).
In response to the degradation of inshore marine
resources in many Pacific countries, governments
and conservation groups are examining whether and
how CMT regimes can be integrated into the modern
conservation context (Cooke et al. 2000, Hoffmann
2002, Johannes 2002). CMT is particularly
important in the context of resource management
because it can serve as the legal and cultural
foundation for other taboos such as gear
prohibitions and spatial restrictions (Ruddle 1998,
Aswani and Hamilton 2004). Where CMT is
recognized, the highly decentralized authority over
marine resources can also facilitate rapid adaptive
response to changes in ecological or social
conditions because decisions about limiting
resource use can be made without the process of
involving a centralized bureaucracy. Basing
resource conservation initiatives around marine
tenure regimes is particularly attractive to
conservation organizations and donors because
enforcement of specific fishing regulations within
a tenure is generally the responsibility of the
resource owner (Asafu-Adjaye 2000). By
empowering community self-enforcement of
fisheries regulations, CMT may provide a costeffective means to reduce the burden on government
intervention, regulation, and enforcement (Johannes
1981, Hviding 1996, Ruddle 1998). This is
particularly important in the economic context of
the Pacific where fisheries departments are typically
understaffed and under-funded (Johannes 1981).
Customary tenure regimes are the foundation of
marine governance in much of the Pacific, but they
must be better understood if they are to be
effectively incorporated in resource management
and development initiatives. In particular, very little
is known about the social and economic frameworks
that allow communities to employ or maintain CMT
regimes. An array of theoretical and empirical
research has shown that common property
governance systems can be affected by
socioeconomic factors such as religious or cultural

homogeneity (Ostrom 1990), market influences
(Hviding 1996, Henrich et al. 2001), transaction
costs of decision-making (Ostrom 1990, Sumalde
2004), dependence on resources (Lise 2000,
Agrawal 2001, Zanetell and Knuth 2004), social
capital (Pretty and Ward 2001, Pretty 2003, Pretty
and Smith 2004), conflicts (Polunin 1984, Adams
et al. 2003) settlement patterns (Aswani 2002,
Aswani and Hamilton 2004), and resource
variability (see Agrawal 2002 for a comprehensive
review of the factors influencing the emergence and
successful functioning of common property
institutions). The studies specific to CMT suggest
that many of these social and economic factors can
influence the nature and function of marine tenure
institutions (Pollnac 1984, Polunin 1984, Baines
1989, Watson 1989, Hviding 1996, Cooke et al.
2000, Foale and Macintyre 2000, Aswani 2002),
although specific relationships between socioeconomic
conditions and CMT are sometimes contradictory
and are still not well understood. For example,
Watson (1989) discusses how changing socioeconomic
conditions can render resource management
strategies ineffective and inappropriate. Alternatively,
Hviding (1996) documents how marine tenure rules
became more exclusive for both commercial and
subsistence activities in the Morovo Lagoon in
response to increased prices of particular shells.
Here I ask the following questions: Which
socioeconomic factors are related to the presence of
CMT regimes? How might these socioeconomic
factors influence the ability of communities to
employ or maintain CMT regimes? To date, most
research examining the social, economic, and
cultural factors influencing CMT has utilized a
relatively small number of cases or examined these
issues over a very limited geographical area. Despite
the important contributions that small n case studies
have made toward understanding CMT regimes, a
fundamental limitation of this approach is that it
does not allow us to discern larger patterns in how
CMT regimes may respond to social and economic
factors over a wider geographical context. In this
paper, I seek to complement the more detailed case
studies on the subject by using a comparative
approach to examine the potential socioeconomic
factors influencing viable CMT institutions in 21
coastal communities in Papua New Guinea and
Indonesia.

METHODS

the market, the type of settlement pattern,
dependence on marine resources, immigration, the
presence of conflicts over marine resources, and the
exclusivity of marine tenure regimes.

Data collection
Between October 2001 and January 2003, research
was conducted in 15 villages in Papua New Guinea
(PNG) and six villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia
(Fig. 1). A number of criteria were used to select
the study sites. Research was conducted as part of
an interdisciplinary Wildlife Conservation Society
project that assessed the effectiveness of coral reef
conservation in the Indo-Pacific (Cinner et al. 2003;
Cinner et al. in press b, McClanahan et al.
unpublished data). Agrawal (2001, 2002) suggests
that purposively selecting sites that have variation
in theoretically significant variables is a defensible
sampling methodology in a common-property
research context. Study sites were purposively
selected to encompass a wide range of social,
economic, demographic, and resource governance
conditions (e.g., varying degrees of remoteness,
marine tenure, market influence, dependence on
marine resources, etc.). However, as a result of the
project's intent to integrate both socioeconomic and
ecological data, site selection was constrained
somewhat by the need to have comparable
ecological parameters at each site (coral reef habitat,
current regimes, exposure, etc.), access to SCUBA
facilities (although live onboard dive boats were
used to access two remote study sites in PNG and
two in Indonesia), and project goals of examining
several specific conservation sites of regional
importance (e.g., Bunaken and Kilu). Based on the
fact that the villages were not randomly selected, a
cautious approach to interpreting the results would
suggest that the conclusions drawn from this study
are not necessarily applicable outside of the study
sites.
Research was conducted over an one to three week
period per village using one to four trained local
assistants to aid in data collection. I used theoretical
and empirical research (e.g., Ostrom 1990, Carrier
and Carrier 1991, Agrawal 2001, Aswani 2002;
Pollnac and Johnson in press) and socioeconomic
assessment methodologies designed for coastal
communities (Pollnac 1998, Bunce et al. 2000,
Pollnac and Crawford 2000) to select indicators that
were expected to be related to marine resource
governance in the Indo-Pacific and that were also
feasible to collect during the limited research time
at each site. These were: population, distance to
markets, the percentage of fish bartered or sold in

A combination of systematic household surveys (for
example, surveying every second or third
household), semi-structured interviews with key
informants (community leaders and resource users),
recording of oral histories, transect walks (walking
through the community with a local to identify and
verify issues), participant observations, descriptions
of daily and seasonal time-use, women’s focus
groups, and analyses of secondary sources such as
population censuses and fisheries records were all
used to gather information and triangulate results.
A total of 954 household surveys were collected.
Sampling within villages was based on a systematic
sample design, where a sampling fraction of every
ith house (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th) was determined by
dividing the total village population by the sample
size (Henry 1990, de Vaus 1991). Variance from
the systematic sample was assumed to be equal to
the estimated variance based on a simple random
sample (Scheaffer et al. 1996). The number of
surveys per community ranged from 15-84 (Table
1), depending largely on the population of the
village, the number of available research assistants,
and the available time per site (this was influenced
by factors such as weather, the availability and
frequency of transportation to certain sites, and
budget requirements such as the cost of the boat
used to access remote sites).
The head of the household was interviewed. If the
head of the household was not available, the
household was revisited later. If the head of the
household was still not available, another adult from
the household was interviewed. The head of the
household could have been either a male or female.
In instances where it was appropriate, more than one
member of the household was interviewed to obtain
the most accurate information about specific
subjects (for example, if a female headed the house
but her eldest son was more knowledgeable about
the household's fishing activities and practices, then
he would be asked about the proportion of fish catch
bartered or sold).
Household surveys were used to gather the
following indicators: dependence on fishing,
immigration, population of the village, and the
percentage of fish sold in the market. Dependence

on fishing was determined by having respondents
list all the occupations the household engaged in for
food or money. Respondents were then asked to rank
these activities in order of importance. Those who
regularly engaged in fishing estimated the
percentage of their fish catch sold or bartered.
Respondents were asked where they were from and
were considered immigrants if they came from
another village. Population was determined by: (1)
counting the number of houses, (2) determining the
average number of persons per household (adults
and children) from the household surveys, and (3)
multiplying this by the number of houses in the
community. This was thought to be more accurate

than relying on census information because the
census record in one community reported almost
twice as many houses as were actually counted.
Key informants were selected using non-probability
sampling techniques, including convenience
sampling (for example, a respondent may be
approached during resource use activities) or
snowball sampling (where community members
will suggest appropriate respondents) (Henry
1990). Between two and fifteen key informants were
interviewed per village. Key informants also
provided information on how exclusive the marine
tenure was. Based on the key informant interviews

and confirmed observations, villages were
classified based on whether they: (1) practiced
highly exclusive marine tenure regimes in which
non-owners had to ask permission to access marine
resources (classified as "strong" or "highly
exclusive" marine tenure), or (2) had less exclusive
or no marine tenure regimes in which non-owners

regularly and openly accessed marine resources
without asking permission (classified as "weak" or
"less exclusive" marine tenure). Situations in which
neighboring villages (non-owners) had been
granted revocable use privileges and regularly
accessed marine resources were also classified as
less exclusive. Although this compartmentalization

http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art36/

of a wide range of marine tenure regimes into
comparable categories have undoubtedly lead to
overly simplistic interpretations of their true
complexities (Hviding 1996, McCay and Jentoft
1998), it is hoped that this will be outweighed by
the ability to examine how marine tenure is related
to different social and economic factors that can be
captured best through a broader-scale comparative
study.
Key informants and secondary sources provided
information on the presence of serious or significant
conflicts over marine resources. I defined conflicts
as intense verbal confrontations, use of violence, or
court cases. Communities that reported conflicts
over the previous 12 months or had court cases
pending were considered to have conflicts. Key
informants also provided information on the nearest
market where marine products were regularly
bought and sold. The distance from the village to
markets were measured on topographic maps and
nautical charts. Communities were grouped into two
types of settlement patterns: dispersed or nucleated.
Dispersed settlements were communities that were
spread out and contained distinct sub-villages that
were geographically separated. For example, the
community of Riwo in Madang, PNG, had subvillages on two separate islands and was thus
considered a dispersed settlement. Nucleated
settlements were communities that were relatively
contiguous.
Analyses
The socioeconomic characteristics of communities
that excluded all non-owners from accessing
resources within their tenure were compared to the
characteristics of communities where non-owners
were allowed to access marine resources. Four types
of analyses were performed to discern whether the
presence of highly exclusive marine tenure was
related to socioeconomic factors: the Mann Whitney
U test, Fisher's Exact test, effect size, and statistical
power.

communities with highly exclusive tenure were
significantly different from communities with low
excludability. For example, I used the Mann
Whitney U test to compare the mean (rank of)
percentage of immigrants in communities with
highly exclusive marine tenure to the mean (rank
of) percentage of immigrants in communities with
weaker marine tenure. The frequency of
dichotomous data (i.e., settlement patterns and the
presence of conflicts) in communities with strong
marine tenure was compared to communities with
weak marine tenure using a Fisher’s Exact test. The
Fisher’s Exact test is a non-parametric analysis used
to discern whether two samples are independent
based on the frequency of observed responses in a
2 x 2 contingency table with small independent
samples (Siegel and Castellan 1988). Liberal p
values were accepted for determining statistical
significance (p<0.1), because this is an exploratory
analysis and, based on the moderate sample size of
21 villages, I did not want to exclude any variables
that might be important (i.e., I thought the
consequences of committing a type I error were
more grave than a type II error). To ensure nationallevel differences were not driving any of the
patterns, significant differences between socioeconomic
characteristics for Indonesian and New Guinean
sites were tested for as well.
Effect size is a standardized measure of the strength
of the relationship between independent and
dependent variables (Vaske et al. 2002). The
Hedge's effect size was calculated as the difference
between the mean socioeconomic conditions of the
two groups (e.g., mean distance to market of the
communities that employed exclusive marine
tenure regimes minus the mean distance to market
of the communities that did not) divided by the
pooled standard deviation of both groups (Gliner et
al. 2001). Statistical power is the probability of
finding a statistically significant result when there
is a real effect in the population being studied (i.e.,
rejecting the null hypothesis when a research
hypothesis is true) (Cohen 1988). The power of
these relationships was calculated using Statistica
6.0 statistical program.

The SPSS 11.01 statistical program was used to
determine statistical significance with the MannWhitney U and Fisher's Exact tests. The MannWhitney U test is a non-parametric alternative to
the T-test, which is used to test whether two samples
are independent (Siegel and Castellan 1988). The
Mann-Whitney U test was used to examine whether
ordinal or interval socioeconomic characteristics of

RESULTS
Socioeconomic characteristics of communities
The 21 communities varied considerably in the
socioeconomic and governance indicators (Table
1). Communities ranged from small hamlets with
only 272 people to large villages of 5,000 people.
The importance of fishing as a livelihood strategy
varied considerably in the communities examined.
The percentage of households that ranked fishing
as the primary occupation varied from 0-77%, with
a mean of 25%. There was also a considerable range
in the market influence (measured as distance to
market and the percentage of fish bartered or sold)
on the communities. Communities ranged from
0-100 km from markets. The mean distance to the
nearest regular market for marine products for all
sites was 37 km and the median distance was 32 km.
The percentage of fish bartered or sold ranged from
13-72% and had a mean of 50%. The percentage of
immigrants ranged from 2-64%, with a mean and
median of 25%. Twelve of the 21 sites were
nucleated settlements and only seven sites reported
conflicts over marine resources. Seven of the 21
communities regularly excluded non-owners from
accessing marine resources. High excludability
occurred in the Sangihe-Talaud part of North
Sulawesi, Indonesia ( Para and Kakarotan
communities), but not the southern communities on
or near the main island. In New Guinea, high
excludability was reported throughout the country.
Socioeconomic factors influencing marine
tenure
Only the population indicator differed significantly
between the sites in New Guinea and Indonesia. The
mean population for the New Guinean sites (970)
was significantly lower than the mean population
for the Indonesian sites (1530) (U = 17, p<0.05).
This lack of difference between countries for other
indicators suggests that national-level differences
in marine tenure or socioeconomic conditions did
not overly influence the analysis.
Four out of seven variables differed significantly
between villages with highly exclusive marine
tenure and those with less exclusive tenure regimes
(Table 2). The presence of conflicts over marine
resources was correlated to the presence of highly

exclusive marine tenure. The percentage of
immigrants was lower in communities with
exclusive marine tenure, the distance to market was
higher in communities with exclusive marine
tenure, and the percentage of households dependent
on fishing was higher in communities with
exclusive marine tenure (although this relationship
was only significant at the p<0.1 level). The large
effect size of these latter three relationships (d>0.93)
suggests that substantial relationships exists (Vaske
et al. 2002) (Table 2). No statistically significant
differences were found in settlement pattern,
population, or the percentage of fish sold in market
between communities with strong and weak marine
tenure. The effect size of the percentage of fish sold
in markets (d=0.1) was very low, suggesting a
minimal relationship (Vaske et al. 2002). However,
the power of this relationship was also very low
(0.05), so it would be difficult to detect differences.
The effect size of population (d=0.37) was
approaching a typical relationship found in the
social sciences (d=0.5) (Vaske et al. 2002), and the
power of this relationship was low (0.12) so the
effect of population may have been real but not
detectable with the sample size used. Note that effect
sizes and power are not computed for dichotomous
indicators (such as settlement pattern and conflicts).
DISCUSSION
This is one of the first studies to quantitatively
explore relationships between socioeconomic
factors and marine tenure over a large spatial scale
with a moderate sample size. This paper found that
communities with strong marine tenure were further
from markets, had lower migration, but had higher
dependence on fishing and conflicts over marine
resources. This study is an important compliment
to the more localized case studies and helps put such
research into a broader context. For example,
Aswani's comparison of marine tenure in the
Roviana and Vonavona lagoons in the Solomon
Islands provide a model for how socioeconomic and
historical factors can result in three marine tenure
patterns (Aswani 1999, 2002, Aswani and Hamilton
2004). Aswani's interpretations of how historical
processes, socioeconomic factors, and demographic
changes affect marine tenure in two coastal villages
in the Solomon Islands suggest market forces and
other exogenous pressures will not necessarily
transform CMT institutions into open-access
regimes (Aswani 1999, 2002). This study found that
the distance to the market was negatively related to

the exclusivity of marine tenure regimes, but
whether the fishery was market or subsistencebased (measured in the percentage of fish bartered
or sold) was not significant. This suggests that the
strength of marine tenure institutions may be
undermined by connectivity to larger markets,
perhaps by introducing new ways of providing
credit and generating prestige (Agrawal 2002).
Commercial or market value for marine products,
however, may not necessarily diminish the strength
of tenure institutions.
To date, conclusions about how heterogeneity
influences the development and maintenance of
common property institutions remain inconclusive.
Heterogeneity (which can include the often
interrelated economic, cultural, religious, and
resource use differences in a society) has been
shown to have positive, negative, or minimal effects
on common property management (Ruttan and
Borgerhoff Mulder 1999, Glaesel 2000, Pollnac et
al. 2001, Bardhan and Dayton-Johnson 2002;
Pollnac and Johnson in press). This study found a
lower proportion of immigrants in communities

with highly exclusive marine tenure institutions,
which is consistent with notions of high social
capital being an important component of
maintaining common-property management regimes
(Pretty 2003). Cultural heterogeneity associated
with immigration may act to increase the transaction
costs of developing, maintaining, and enforcing
marine tenure regulations (Aswani and Hamilton
2004). Trust, reciprocal arrangements, and
consistent norms are important components of
social capital (Pretty and Smith 2004) that may be
affected by a high proportion of immigrants.
Likewise, immigrants may not perceive the rules,
processes, and authorities governing marine tenure
to be legitimate, and thus may not comply with
established rules (Sutinen and Kuperan 1999).
The relationship found between high dependence
on marine resources and the exclusivity of marine
tenure regimes is consistent with research on an
array of common pool resources that suggests a
positive relationship may exist between resource
dependence and participation in common property
arrangements (Lise 2000, Agrawal 2002, Zanetell

and Knuth 2004). Communities with high
dependence on marine resources may employ
exclusive marine tenure regimes to increase
livelihood security. For example, the Andra and
Ahus Island study sites in Manus, PNG, are small
infertile islands surrounded by large (>5 km2) reef
lagoons. Islanders have limited access to essential
terrestrial resources (e.g., vegetables and firewood)
and consequently their dependence on marine
resources is very high (Cinner et al. in press a).
These communities claim exclusive rights to marine
resources on the reefs surrounding their islands and
reefs along the coast of the main Manus Island
(Carrier 1987, Carrier and Carrier 1989; Cinner et
al. in press a), preventing mainland communities
from accessing marine resources. These exclusive
marine tenure regimes help to create an economic
monopoly on marine resources among fishing
communities (Malinowski 1935) and help to ensure
that island communities have desirable goods to sell
or trade in local markets (Carrier 1987; Cinner et al.
in press a), thereby improving their livelihood
security.
There are several possible explanations for the
relationship between the presence of conflicts and
exclusive marine tenure regimes. Some researchers
suggest that marine tenure regimes may have
developed in response to conflicts and may serve to
mitigate them (Pollnac 1984, Polunin 1984). On the
other hand, the complexity of use rights associated
with marine tenure institutions can cause them to be
continually challenged (Foale and Macintyre 2000).
In Indonesia, the lack of legal recognition of marine
tenure also seemed to cause conflicts over marine
resources. For example, while researching in Para
Island, North Sulawesi, long-standing tenure rights
were challenged by neighboring communities who
claimed that exclusive tenure rights were not legal
under Indonesia’s constitution and attempted to fish
in Para's fishing grounds. The Para community
responded by brandishing a firearm to chase off
fishers from the other community. Interrelationships
among indicators may also help to explain the
relationship between conflicts and exclusive marine
tenure regimes. For example, communities with
exclusive marine tenure regimes (with high
dependence on marine resources) used confiscation
of fishing equipment, intimidation, and even
violence to enforce their tenure. Communities with
lower dependence on marine resources may find the
additional livelihood security that might be gained
from employing exclusive marine tenure is not
worth engaging the conflicts associated with this

type of territory defense.
Several of the factors expected to be related to the
presence of CMT did not demonstrate significant
relationships, including population and settlement
patterns. In a review of the factors influencing the
sustainability of common property institutions,
Agrawal (2002) notes that debates concerning the
effect of population on common property
institutions are highly polarized. Results from this
study as to the effect of population on the presence
of exclusive marine tenure regimes are
inconclusive. The possibility exists that the sample
size used here was too small to detect differences in
these indicators, particularly considering the effect
size for population was approaching a moderate
effect. More interestingly though, is the possibility
that the populations in the communities studied
were too small to detect any effect. Gabagaba and
Para were two of the five largest communities in my
study (the 4th and 5th largest populations,
respectively), but employed CMT (Table 1). These
communities had populations of fewer than 2,000
and the largest population of any community studied
was 5,000 residents. Harkes and Novaczek (2002)
found that traditional management in Indonesia
(called Sasi) dies out in villages greater than 3,000
people. However, Evans et al. (1997) noted that Sasi
was present in a community larger than 14,000
people. Therefore, based on previous research, the
critical population size at which CMT may cease to
function effectively may not have been reached in
this study (or reached by only the two sites with
populations >3,000). The population levels of many
of the study sites were similar to many rural coastal
areas in the provinces studied (e.g., National
Statistics Office 2002a, b), however, urbanized
areas with high populations were not examined. An
interesting area of further inquiry would be to
examine whether or how communities with tens of
thousands of residents could support highly
exclusive marine tenure regimes. Aswani (2002),
and Aswani and Hamilton (2004) also speculated
that nucleated and dispersed settlement patterns
influenced whether and how communities in the
Solomon Islands could develop and maintain
marine tenure regimes. Although this study was not
able to explore in-depth ethnographic accounts of
settlement histories, no relationship was found
between settlement patterns and the strength of
marine tenure institutions. In the broader context,
this suggests that whether communities are
nucleated or dispersed may be less important than
other socioeconomic factors in maintaining marine

tenure regimes.
One of the initial concerns with this study was that
national or regional factors might overshadow the
village level factors examined. However, this did
not appear to be the case: there were few significant
differences in socioeconomic characteristics
between the two countries and several adjacent or
nearby communities reported different marine
tenure regimes, supporting the notion that marine
tenure can vary in response to village-level factors
and is not only a product of regional sociocultural
influences. For example, Madina and Fissoa were
nearby communities of a common language group,
but Madina had high excludability and Fissoa had
low excludability. Another potential concern was
that intersite variability in the resource might have
been very high, which could conceivably influence
the nature of the marine tenure institutions.
Incorporating the ecological criteria in site selection
provided a reasonable assurance that relatively little
variance existed in the resources within each tenure
(i.e., the tenure areas all contain comparable coral
reefs in similar ecological zones). Furthermore, we
can infer from other analyses of the resources within
these sites (Cinner et al. unpublished data; Cinner
et al. in press-b; Cinner and McClanahan
unpublished data) that many of the commercially
valuable species harvested within the tenure sites
such as trochus, beche de mer, and reef fish have
small home ranges (e.g., on the scale of hectares to
kilometers) (Kramer and Chapman 1999) congruent
to the scale of the tenure areas. Therefore, the
possible variance in resource conditions is expected
to have relatively little influence in the observed
tenure institutions.
Speculation
This study was able to tease out several indicators
that were of more importance than others and
provide qualitative descriptions of how these factors
may be related to the presence of CMT. The
limitations inherent in the non-random design of this
study mean these results apply only to these study
sites and should not be generalized to the wider
region. Keeping in mind the limitations of this
study's methodology, it is important to speculate on
whether and how these regimes will be able to adapt
and respond to changes in socioeconomic
conditions.
Marine tenure systems are dynamic institutions that,

through adaptation to changing scenarios, have
proven relatively robust to population pressures and
aspects of economic and political modernization
(Hviding 1998). However, Asia-Pacific is a region
undergoing profound social, economic, and
demographic changes (UNEP 2002), and there may
be social forces that marine tenure regimes are
unable to adapt to. Results from this study suggest
that socioeconomic changes that will increase
immigration, open new markets, and decrease
dependence on marine resources may influence the
ability of communities to employ or maintain
exclusive marine tenure regimes. Under these
scenarios, conservation and development strategies
that rely on high excludability in a community's
tenure may become challenged at their foundation.
Alternatively, results from this study also suggest
CMT may be somewhat resilient to other
socioeconomic factors such as population growth.
Highly exclusive CMT can operate in communities
with populations of 1,700, but strong CMT is related
to low levels of immigration. This suggests that high
endogenous population growth (i.e., not from
immigration) in smaller communities may not affect
the ability to employ viable marine tenure.
The next research challenge is to address the
applicability of these results to the wider region. A
random selection of villages that could be
considered representative of the region would be
desirable for future studies. Another research
priority is determining what specific aspects of these
variables influence marine tenure. For example,
high immigration may cause confusion over use
rights, disrupt traditional information exchange
mechanisms, and/or introduce new ideas that
challenge traditional practices. A better understanding
of how these factors influence marine tenure
regimes will allow development and conservation
organizations to target capacity building and other
activities to potentially increase the resilience of
Pacific conservation strategies against the forces of
social change.
