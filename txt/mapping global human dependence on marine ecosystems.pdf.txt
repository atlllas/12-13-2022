Abstract
Many human populations are dependent on marine ecosystems for a range of beneﬁts, but we understand little about where and to what degree people rely on these
ecosystem services. We created a new conceptual model to map the degree of human
dependence on marine ecosystems based on the magnitude of the beneﬁt, susceptibility of people to a loss of that beneﬁt, and the availability of alternatives. We
focused on mapping nutritional, economic, and coastal protection dependence, but
our model is repeatable, scalable, applicable to other ecosystems, and designed to
incorporate additional services and data. Here we show that dependence was highest for Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean island nations and several West African countries.
More than 775 million people live in areas with relatively high dependence scores.

I N T RO D U C T I O N

The value of living natural resources to human well-being is
becoming increasingly well-recognized, including the importance of marine ecosystems to people (Arkema, Verutes, &
Wood, 2015; FAO, 2016; Hall, Hilborn, Andrew, & Allison,
2013; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Coastal
and inland populations derive a range of monetary and nonmonetary beneﬁts from marine ecosystems including nutritional, economic, cultural, and coastal protection beneﬁts. For
example, marine ﬁsheries are a critical source of lipids and
micronutrients (Kawarazuka & Bene, 2010), support more
than 260 million livelihoods (Teh & Sumaila, 2013), generate
sizeable revenues for many countries, including US$ 80 billion dollars in export revenues for developing countries (FAO,
2016), and provide substantial coastal protection services with
coral reefs reducing wave heights by up to 70% (Narayan,
Beck, & Reguero, 2016).
Although these numbers provide a snapshot of the magnitude of beneﬁts that living marine resources (hereafter
marine resources) can provide, they oﬀer only limited guidance on the ways in which people are dependent and how that
dependence varies spatially. This knowledge gap poses challenges for regional and national policymakers as well as funders, who risk ignoring or underestimating the importance of
marine ecosystems in policy eﬀorts and large-scale management planning. To make more eﬀective policy and management decisions, we need a conceptual understanding of dependence and a quantitative estimate of how and where people
depend on natural ecosystems for their well-being.
Prominent recent initiatives highlight the importance of
integrating sustainable development and resource use into
environmental management, including the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Sustainable Development Platform, 2014). Sustainable management of marine
resources is important for several SDGs including those
related to poverty (goal 1), hunger (goal 2), health (goal 3),
economic growth (goal 8), and climate-related disaster risk
reduction (goal 13), and sustainable ocean management (goal
14) (Sustainable Development Platform, 2014). Understanding patterns of human dependence on marine resources is necessary for achieving these goals and for improving human
well-being through better resource management. In order to

design policies and management that meet multiple SDGs,
decision-makers need to understand the mechanisms that create dependence.
In a ﬁrst attempt to provide such information, we designed
a novel quantitative framework for assessing dependence that
is spatially scalable, repeatable, and applicable across diﬀerent ecosystems. Our framework is also capable of incorporating additional indicators or ecosystem service dependencies.
We applied our framework globally to assess three diﬀerent
types of dependence on marine resources—nutritional, economic, and coastal protection—using global, publicly available indicators (Table 1; Figure 1). Our focus is on assessing the relative degree of dependence, but we also estimate
where the greatest concentrations of highly dependent people
are located. Our results illustrate where people are relatively
more dependent on marine resources and for what key beneﬁts, so that policies and large-scale planning can be designed
more eﬀectively.

M ETH O DS
Degree of dependence

Using expert input, we identiﬁed four key types of dependence on marine resources: nutritional, economic, coastal
protection, and cultural (Supporting Methods; Table 1).
Marine ecosystems are key to cultural identity and well-being
(Russell, Guerry, & Balvanera, 2013), but we lacked global
indicators to include it.
Original data resolution varied by data source, but all calculations were done on a 0.167 decimal degree grid (∼17 km at
the equator) to preserve some of the underlying spatial variability in the datasets. For nutritional and economic dependence, we take the mean of all grid cell values within a country and report our results at the national scale because most
data were at that scale (Table S1). Data for coastal protection were largely at ﬁner scales so coastal protection maps
reﬂect the 0.167 decimal degree grid scale (Figure 1). For
each type of dependence and mechanism, we chose relevant
indicators (Table 1), transformed them to meet assumptions of
normality, and standardized them [0-1] (Supporting Methods;
Table S3).

Susceptibility

Measure of people's ability to purchase substitutes
(e.g., storm defenses), institutional capacity for
disaster preparedness, and infrastructure for
dealing with ﬂooding. Higher values indicate
greater substitutability.

Measure of the proportion of the population
susceptible to storms and sea-level rise. Higher
values indicate more people are susceptible.

Measure of the beneﬁt to human populations
(proportion of population, scaled nationally) from
coral reefs and mangroves in reducing exposure
from storms and sea-level rise. Higher values
indicate greater beneﬁt.

Measures of the ﬁnancial resources available, ability
to obtain other employment, or to address issues
in the ﬁsheries sector (e.g., retraining). Higher
values indicate higher substitutability.

Measure of macroeconomic and microeconomic
stability, where negative trends indicate more
susceptibility to ﬁsheries revenue and job losses.

Measure of the availability of alternatives for protein
and fat and ﬁnancial resources to purchase them.
Higher values indicate greater substitutability.
Measures of the proportional beneﬁt provided by
ﬁsheries (based on exports and ﬁshing access
agreements) to national revenue and the number
of jobs to national employment. Higher values
indicate greater beneﬁt.

Source for conceptual link

Measure of food utilization, where higher values
indicate greater susceptibility.

Measure of the amount of marine protein in animal
protein intake, a proxy for the consumption of
micronutrients. Higher values indicate greater
beneﬁt.

Degree of human dependence on marine ecosystems for (A) nutritional, (B) economic (ﬁsheries), and (C) coastal protection

dependence

2.2

Population analyses

We also identiﬁed where the greatest concentrations of people that have relatively high dependence are located. First, we
focused our analysis on regions that were within 200 miles of
the coastline (Bright, Coleman, Rose, & Urban, 2012), where
dependence on marine ecosystems is likely more direct. Then
we excluded areas that had a density less than 1 person per
kilometer grid cell. Within these coastal regions, we identiﬁed places where the dependence value was in the top 10% of

values for one of the three dependence types. Then we calculated the number of people living in these regions of relatively
high dependence (Bright et al., 2012).

Robustness analyses

require an analysis of their robustness to diﬀerent construction algorithms (Saisana, Saltelli, & Tarantola, 2005). For the

calculation of each dependence type, we standardized indicators [0-1] to ensure that indicators with larger ranges did
not have greater importance in the analysis. We then calculated robustness metrics to determine whether our results
were robust to diﬀerent standardization methods (min-max,
z-score, deviation from the mean) and diﬀerent aggregation
approaches (workshop-deﬁned formula, arithmetic mean,
geometric mean) that were used to combine indicators to calculate each dependence type (Table 1) (OECD and European
Commission's Joint Research Center 2008; Supporting Methods). To calculate integrated dependence (mean across dependence types), we weighted each dependence type equally.

RESULTS
Human dependence framework

We developed an overall conceptual framework to quantify nutritional, economic, and coastal protection dependence
on marine ecosystems (Supporting Methods; Table 1). This
quantitative framework is based on three key mechanisms: the
magnitude of the beneﬁt of the ecosystem service, the susceptibility of the human population to a loss of that beneﬁt, and
the level of substitutability of that beneﬁt (Table 1). For each
mechanism and type of dependence, we then identiﬁed indicators that have a conceptual link established in previous studies
for quantifying that mechanism (Table 1). The general form of
the framework is:
(
Dependence = 𝐵 ×

(
))
𝐶̄ + 1 − 𝑆̄
2

,

(1)

where B is the magnitude of the ecosystem beneﬁt of the
service, 𝐶̄ is the mean of the susceptibility indicators, and
𝑆̄ is the mean of the substitutability indicators. The magnitude of the ecosystem beneﬁt (hereafter, beneﬁt) of the service
is deﬁned as the “current” (based on most recently available
data), realized beneﬁt from an ecosystem service (Balmford,
Fisher, & Green, 2011). This deﬁnition does not account for
sustainability, so current levels of dependence may not be met
in the future if demand exceeds supply. By focusing on realized beneﬁts, we also implicitly account for cases where there
may be greater supply, but less demand. Substitutability was
broadly deﬁned as a function of the quantity and diversity of
alternatives and their accessibility, including having the ﬁnancial resources to obtain or build alternatives. Greater substitutability will generally mean less dependence, so we take the
inverse for all substitutability indicators. We chose a linear
function because there is no evidence that these factors would
have an exponential relationship. In our framework, dependence results from the multiplicative relationship between the
magnitude of beneﬁt of the service (B) and susceptibility (C)

and substitutability (S) because the factors interact with each
other. Because dependence is based on a realized ecosystem
beneﬁt and the indicators for susceptibility and substitutability are based on vulnerability to a loss of that speciﬁc beneﬁt,
we do not calculate dependence when B is absent or zero. If a
susceptibility (C) and substitutability (S) indicator is absent,
we take the mean of the available indicators. The relationship
between susceptibility (C) and substitutability (B) is additive
because they can compensate for each other to some extent. If
substitutability is high, the population may be less susceptible to a loss of the service because an alternative is available.
We did not apply any weighting because there is currently no
conceptual evidence to support it. The form of the calculation for each type of dependence followed Equation (1), but
varied slightly (Table 1). We ﬁnd our results are robust to
diﬀerent standardization-aggregation approaches (Supporting
Results).

3.2

Dependence patterns

Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean island nations, several countries
along the west coast of Africa, and some countries in Southeast Asia ranked highest for nutritional and economic dependence (Figure 1A,B; Table S6). Although nutritional and
economic dependence were relatively correlated (Pearson correlation coeﬃcient = 0.58; P < 0.0001), several countries
exhibited high dependence by one measure, but not the other
(Figures 1A,B and S8). When economic dependence was disaggregated, dependence on jobs versus revenue also showed
modest correlation (Figures 2 and S9; Table S6; Pearson
correlation coeﬃcient = 0.64, P < 0.0001). Coastal protection showed relatively distinct patterns from both nutritional
(Pearson correlation coeﬃcient = −0.07; P < 0.51) and economic dependence (Pearson correlation coeﬃcient = −0.12;
P < 0.21), with the highest values along cyclone-prone coasts
(Figure 1C). When data for all three types of dependence were
available (40% of countries), countries with highest mean
dependence were Kiribati, the Maldives, and Tuvalu (Figure 3, Table S6). Across all countries, Kiribati also had the
highest cumulative (total value across all types of dependence) dependence (Figure S10).
Country rankings changed signiﬁcantly when we calculated where the greatest numbers of people with relatively
high dependence were located (Tables 2 and S7–S10). Globally, more than 775 million people were in the top 10% of one
of the dependence types (Table 2).

and planning processes that maintain the essential beneﬁts
people rely on. Our results highlight countries where societies and economies are dependent on ecosystem beneﬁts
from coastal and marine ecosystems. Patterns varied by country and type of dependence, but many island nations in the
Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans had high levels of dependence
(Figure 1) whereas countries like Indonesia and the Philippines had greater concentrations of people with relatively
high dependence (Table 2). By identifying which types of
dependence are important and the mechanisms underlying
them, policy can be better tailored to meet the needs of these
populations.

4.1

Mechanisms of dependence

We found nutritional dependence to be highest in West
Africa and in several Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean island nations,
although scores were also relatively high for some developed
countries (Figure 1A; Table S6). Drivers of high scores varied by the mechanism underpinning the dependence (Table 1).
High dependence scores in Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean island
nations and several developed countries (e.g., Norway, Iceland, and Japan) were driven by high ﬁsh consumption rates
(i.e., high magnitude of beneﬁt) or a strong cultural preference
for ﬁsh. By contrast, high dependence in West African countries was driven by diﬀerent mechanisms, principally high
susceptibility (i.e., the percentage of underweight children)
combined with low substitutability (low dietary diversity and
low GDP) (Figures S1B–D and S1j). These results not only
highlight where human populations are dependent on marine
resources for their nutrition, but also how the mechanisms that
contribute to this dependence vary in diﬀerent geographies.
Economic dependence patterns varied depending on the
relative importance of jobs or revenues in diﬀerent countries
(Figures 2 and S9). Countries with high dependence on revenue from ﬁsheries exports or foreign ﬁshing access agreements were generally those with major pelagic ﬁsheries or
high value ﬁsheries like tuna (Figure 2; Table 3). High dependence for jobs was more common in countries with sizeable
small-scale ﬁsheries (Teh & Sumaila, 2013). Future analyses could assess ﬁshing eﬀort by foreign vessel ﬂeets, the

EEZs targeted by those ﬂeets (Pauly & Zeller, 2016), export
data on volume (FAO, 2014), and ﬁsh price databases (Tai,
Cashion, Lam, Swartz, & Sumaila, 2017) to better understand
how international harvesting patterns and trade may aﬀect
economic dependence.
Results for coastal protection dependence showed relatively distinct patterns from both nutritional and economic
dependence (Figure 1C). In our analyses, high coastal protection dependence arises from a combination of high cyclonic
storm frequency as well as the presence of key habitats−coral
reefs and mangroves−that protect coastal areas (Table 1). We
could not completely account for impacts from low frequency,
but high severity storms such as those that may occur in
Myanmar and Bangladesh (Figure S1l; Needham, Keim, &
Sathiaraj, 2015). In addition, we underestimate dependence
in temperate regions because we did not have data on noncyclonic or extratropical storms or the extent of salt marshes,
dune systems, and oyster reefs. Furthermore, various localscale physical and ecological variables besides ecosystem
presence will determine protective capacity (Arkema, Guannel, & Verutes, 2013). As more temperate ecosystem and
exposure data become available, we can incorporate them
into our framework to better assess global coastal protection
dependence.
Analyzing patterns of mean dependence across available
types of dependence highlights places where there are multiple, interacting beneﬁts (Figures 3 and S10; Table S6). High
dependence often also includes high susceptibility and low
substitutability, which may indicate strong vulnerability to a
loss of the beneﬁts from marine resources. In places where
there are multiple dependencies, policymakers must also consider how best to manage across them.

4.2 Population concentrations of high
dependence
Roughly, 775 million people were found to be relatively highly
dependent on marine ecosystems (top 10% of values for one
of the three type of dependence; Tables 2 and S7–S10). Of
these, 525 million people were found to be relatively highly
dependent on marine ecosystems for nutrition, illustrating

the importance of marine ﬁsheries to food security (Béné,
Barange, & Subasinghe, 2015). More focus on these places
may be needed, both in local management and in supply
chains originating there, to ensure sustainable resource management and a continuation of these beneﬁts in the face of
increased human needs and pressures on marine resources.

4.3

Linking people to ecosystems

Our quantitative model was designed to be scale-independent
and ﬂexible enough to incorporate improvements over time
in the underlying datasets or the addition of more indicators
(Table 1). We used global, publicly available datasets for our
analysis (Table S1; Allison, 2011). For some indicators, we
used proxies such as the percent of GDP from ﬁsheries export

revenues, because domestic ﬁsheries revenue data were not
available (Table 1). With ﬁner-scale data, dependence could
be calculated at more local, community-level scales.
All types of ecosystem beneﬁts ﬂow across space from
ecosystems to people, but social, institutional, and knowledge
mechanisms aﬀect access to beneﬁts (Hicks & Cinner, 2014).
Many of the direct nutritional (e.g., ﬁsh caught) and economic beneﬁts (e.g., ﬁsh processing) can be exported by communities or traded internationally (Swartz, Rashid Sumaila,
Watson, & Pauly, 2010), making interventions for resource
management and poverty reduction less clear (Béné, Arthur,
& Norbury, 2016; Daw, Brown, Rosendo, & Pomeroy, 2011).
Recent work has calculated spatial variation in estimates of

are likely to be dependent on marine ecosystems services,
which is a key step in linking people to the ecosystems that
they depend on. More local-scale beneﬁt transfer modeling
and supply chain analyses would deepen our understanding of
how and where speciﬁc ecosystems are providing beneﬁts, the
magnitude of those beneﬁts and to whom they are accruing.

Management and policy implications

Our results suggest that management may need to be customized according to which type of dependence is present
if beneﬁts are to be maintained (Allison 2011) (Table 3). By
examining patterns in the types of dependence, policymakers
can determine whether ecosystem health is primarily a concern for the safety of people and property in the coastal zone
(coastal zone management and habitat protection policies),
their nutrition and health (food, nutrition and public health
policy) (Allison, Koehn, Franz, Wiegers, & Callens, 2017),
their employment prospects (labor mobility and enterprise
development, ﬁshery management and development policies),
or the role that an important sector of the maritime economy,
like ﬁsheries, plays in national economic development (ﬁsheries management and trade policies) (Allison, 2011). Policy
and management interventions can then be tailored to address
the speciﬁc barriers to sustainable development (Table 3).
For example, countries with relatively high economic
dependence associated with ﬁsheries revenues like Mauritania may focus on consolidation and eﬃciency measures.
Depending on the country, these could include reducing perverse subsidies (Arnason, Kelleher, & Willmann, 2008) or
implementing real cost recovery (Le Manach, Chaboud, &
Copeland, 2013) (Table 3). On the other hand, countries that
rely on ﬁsheries as a source of employment such as Senegal or Palau may want to focus on supporting small-scale
enterprises (Allison, 2011) (Table 3). Indeed, ﬁsheries management measures for revenue versus employment may also
diﬀer. Broadly, ﬁshing mortality from ﬁshing at open access
equilibrium maximizes employment, whereas ﬁshing mortality at Maximum Economic Yield maximizes macroeconomic
beneﬁts (Table 3). Policy measures could also aim to “diversify the dependence” by having a portfolio of ﬁsheries that
focus variously on exports, employment, or food security.
With information on what drives dependence and how beneﬁts are delivered, policymakers can try to develop policies
and interventions that support the continued delivery of beneﬁts from those services.
In developing management strategies, policymakers and
managers must also consider that maximizing the delivery of one category of beneﬁts may have trade-oﬀs for the
delivery of other beneﬁts and the well-being of diﬀerent
groups (Daw, Coulthard, & Cheung, 2015). For example,
a focus on the delivery of ﬁsh to local communities that
are nutritionally dependent may result in less private invest-

ment in those ﬁsheries as a commercial enterprise and less
macroeconomic revenue (Allison, 2011; Bailey & Jentoft,
1990). On the other hand, there are potential “win-wins” for
dependent communities such as the maintenance of coastal
habitats like mangroves that serve both as nursery habitats for ﬁsheries and providers of coastal protection services
(Barbier et al., 2011). Maximizing synergies while minimizing trade-oﬀs will require understanding the physical and ecological requirements needed to generate multiple beneﬁts,
their accessibility (Hicks & Cinner, 2014) and the full suite
of potential trade-oﬀs (Daw et al., 2015) to meet the needs of
diﬀerent, dependent beneﬁciaries.
A better understanding and representation of where and
how people are dependent on marine ecosystems can help
improve the integration of ﬁsheries and marine ecosystems
into discussions about sustainable development and poverty
alleviation, particularly those focused on food security and
livelihoods with the SDGs. Our novel conceptual framework
provides an eﬀective, streamlined approach for identifying
dependent populations. Policymakers can then use this framework to design more eﬀective development and resource management policies and practices to ensure that marine resources
are sustainably managed for the beneﬁts that are important to
dependent populations.
