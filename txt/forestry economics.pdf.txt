CHAPTER FIVE

FORESTRY ECONOMICS
The time for felling the great oaks was one of the chief problems
of the timber grower. There was a “psychological” moment for cutting, when the tree would yield a greater profit than at any other
time. Oaks, it will be remembered, grow very slowly. The period of
maturity is reached between the ages of eighty and a hundred and
twenty years … [u]p to that time it was not profitable to cut oaks
for ship timber because of the additional value of a large-sized tree.
Beyond that period of maturity, the risk of decay was great … [the]
results of a century of patience might be wasted in attempting
to grow great stern-posts or beams. (Robert Albion, Forests and
Sea Power (1965), describing the key problem facing the
British Navy in encouraging land owners to grow timber for
the fleet)

INTRODUCTION

Forests have been a fundamental part of the natural landscape through human
history. They have provided fuel, foodstuffs, building materials, and have even
been considered a strategic resource, providing the timbers to build the great
ships through which some countries asserted their power for over three centuries.
Throughout early European history, forests were considered at best a nuisance
and barrier to development, and at worst, symbolized barbarism, far different
from modern western attitudes that now see them as valuable repositories of cultural values and social significance.
Today, interest in forests covers the wide spectrum of goods and uses they provide, ranging from commercial timber production to environmental services, to
their social and cultural significance for forest-dwelling indigenous groups as well
as society as a whole. Forestry economics has also broadened its focus from the
study of the production of timber or forest products to more complex problems
involving the important environmental amenities forests can provide as well as
the critical role they play in sustaining ecosystems and rural communities.

RESOURCE ECONOMICS

The timber that is harvested, as is the case of other renewable resources,
replenishes itself over time. The key problem in forestry is to determine the best
time to harvest that timber and indeed, to what extent management of the forest
should emphasize timber production. Several distinctive characteristics of
forestry distinguish it from other renewable resources, such as fisheries, and these
differences continue to shape both the research direction and questions in the area
of forest economics.
The principal difference is the long time span associated with forest growth.
Some forests may not produce commercial timber until the trees are eighty years
or older; some old growth forests contain trees over five hundred years old. Time
also plays a role in the second difference. Trees are both a capital input as well as
output because tree growth is a function of the age of the trees and hence of the
standing biomass, much as is the case in fisheries. Decision-makers face the choice
each year as to whether to hold the trees for another year (treat them as a capital
stock) or harvest the entire biomass (output). Complicating the decision is the fact
that a forest is capable of producing other goods and services that may also be
dependent upon the age of the trees.
Finally, there is the pervasiveness of multiple outputs from forests and the
positive and negative externalities associated with different uses of the forest.
Many of these externalities involve environmental services and amenities that have
no market values or price, further complicating the decision-maker’s problem.
A subject that has received growing attention in forestry has been the institutional arrangements under which forests are used. Such issues range from the
divergence between practice and theory in public forest management, to land use
policies and deforestation. Indeed, much of the research involving forests hinges
on not only the economic circumstances surrounding a particular forest, the host
of biophysical factors associated with it, but also the social and economic context
under which the forest is utilized. In this chapter, we will review the biological
and economic aspects of forestry that contribute to these distinctive characteristics, the economic models used in forestry, and provide an overview of the current
issues involving forestry and how institutions can influence their use.

5.2

THE WORLD’S FORESTS

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN defines forests as areas
where the tree canopy covers 10 percent of the area. Forests cover 30 percent of the
world’s landmass, with nearly one-third of that found in Europe, including Russia
(table 5.1). The distribution of forests across the different continents differs significantly: forests cover less than one-fifth of Asia, while over half of South America
is forested. Measured in per capita terms, Asia is the poorest in forest resources,
while Oceania is the richest (reflecting Australia and New Zealand’s large forest
areas relative to their populations).

Just under half of the world’s forests are found within the tropical regions
(table 5.2). These forests are dominated by hardwood species and are characterized
by mild temperatures and growing conditions that permit growth year round. The
tropical rain forests found predominantly in South America, Africa, and Asia sustain
the highest levels of biodiversity found in the world. Temperate forests include
softwood and hardwood species and characterize the forests found in the US and
Central and Northern Europe that have historically provided most of the wood used
to produce lumber, pulp, and paper. The boreal forest, the second largest type, occupies a broad swathe of land extending across Alaska, Canada, and northern Russia.
Despite the wide distribution of forests, just five countries account for over half
of the world’s forests (table 5.3). Forests account for over half of the area of the
Russian Federation and Brazil, while these two countries, along with Canada, are
the most abundant in terms of forest resources measured on a per capita basis.

Natural and plantation forests
Humans have planted trees throughout human history, and sometimes in great
quantities, for a variety of ends. Today there are plantations that have been
established for environmental objectives, to control erosion and halt desertification;

social objectives, the provision of fuelwood and building materials for rural
communities; and economic objectives, the production of fiber for industrial
purposes. In 2000, plantations covered 186.7 million ha or just under 5 percent of the
world’s forest area. In some countries, such as India and China, they account for
over 25 percent of the area classified as forest. In New Zealand, commercial plantations now provide virtually all the timber for the country’s forest products industry.
Commercial plantations are commonly established with fast growing species
such as eucalyptus, acacia, and certain pine species. Under suitable growing

FORESTRY ECONOMICS

conditions some species can be harvested in as little as seven years. On shorter
rotations they can provide fiber suitable for pulp and papermaking and fiberboard,
while longer-term rotations are required if they are to provide fiber for lumber
and other solid wood products. Table 5.4 shows some representative rotation and
growth rates for some commonly grown plantation species and compares them
to the growth rates for natural forests found in different regions of the world. The
growth rates can differ by an order of magnitude or more between natural forests
and plantations. In part, this reflects the more favorable growing conditions associated with plantations in tropical and temperate areas, but also the application of
additional inputs such as fertilizer and the use of selected cultivars.

5.3

BIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF FORESTS

One of the main issues involved in modeling forestry problems is that of choosing
the appropriate scale. The forest may be as small as a five-hectare private woodlot or span two continents (as is the case for the boreal forest covering the northern part of Europe and North America). It may contain a diverse mix of tree
species, or in the case of a plantation, homogeneous timber stands distinguished
only by age.
The most common unit of analysis used in investigating forestry issues is the
timber stand. In general, a timber stand consists of trees within a contiguous area
that share similar characteristics such as age, species composition, or site quality.
A forest can then be made up of a number of stands that are commonly managed
as individual units.
The fact that trees are fixed in location has several important implications. First,
it is possible to gather relatively precise information about certain aspects of the
resource, such as existing timber volumes and expected future timber volumes.
Second, the economic and environmental benefits associated with timber stands
can vary directly with their location. Third, it is possible to specify property rights
(see chapter 2) that can be assigned to the trees alone or extend to the land on
which they stand that has important implications for how forests are managed.
In general, a stand becomes more valuable with age as the standing volume
increases. In addition, it is also often assumed that the per unit volume value of
trees also increases with age, reflecting the higher prices associated with older and
larger trees. At the same time, the environmental amenities associated change as
a timber stand matures. There are a number of different variables, including but
not limited to: forage for both domestic grazing stock and wildlife; wildlife habitat; water flow; and recreation opportunities. The flow of these benefits from a
timber stand changes over time as trees mature. Some of these may vary inversely
with the age of the trees; for example, forage opportunities and water flows will
decrease as trees grow and their canopies close while recreational values may
increase. The abundance of different plant and animal species will change as the
habitat changes; some species such as spotted owls or woodland caribou prefer

134

RESOURCE ECONOMICS

mature timber, while others such as deer are better adapted to the more open
conditions commonly associated with younger forests. The ability of trees to
sequester carbon is also dependent upon the size and age of the trees.
A forest can contain a diverse mix of stands, where local factors such as the
average temperature; precipitation patterns; and soil fertility; and local variations
in topography favor particular tree species over others. The location of the forest
or stand also influences the economic value of the trees; the costs involved in
transporting the timber to processing facilities and eventually to markets, and the
harvesting costs associated with the terrain (again influenced by local factors)
determine the ultimate value of the standing timber.
Within a forest, these costs may be such that standing timber has no commercial
value (since the price of the forest products that can be derived from the wood, net
of all processing costs, just equals these transportation and harvesting costs). This
limit marks the extensive margin, beyond which trees have no commercial value.
These timber stands may consist of the forest that lies in remote areas, far from any
transportation system or processing facilities, or timber stands found in rugged
terrain. Other land uses, such as agriculture, may also compete with forestland.
Where the economic returns to forestland equal those of competing land uses, this
delineates the intensive margin. The intensive margin is also used to sometimes
describe the level of economic utilization within a timber stand; certain species or
smaller trees may be uneconomic and therefore be left behind, depending upon
harvesting policies.

Choosing when to harvest
The typical relationship between the age of a timber stand (or tree) and volume is
shown in figure 5.1. The growth rate increases over time to a maximum, then
declines and eventually becomes zero when trees cease growing as they reach
maturity (and may actually become negative when trees are lost to rot and decay).
The average annual increase in tree or timber stand volume is known as the Mean
Annual Increment, or MAI, while the annual increase in timber volume (the change
in volume from year to year) is known as the Current Annual Increment or CAI. A
common management approach has been to choose the harvest age at which the
MAI of the trees in the timber stand is maximized (which is sometimes called the
Culmination of the MAI or CMAI). In a forest where the number of even-aged
stands equals the rotation age, harvesting a stand each year and replanting that
stand will yield the maximum harvest by volume that can be sustained over time
(since each stand advances in age and the trees that are Tm1 mature will become
available for harvest in the succeeding year). The problem is formulated as then
choosing the time to harvest, T, that maximizes harvest volumes over time.

Figure 5.2 shows the MAI (which corresponds to the average product curve or
V(T)/T) and the CAI (the marginal product curve or V’(T) ) based on the growth
function depicted in figure 5.1. The CMAI is reached where the CAI crosses the
MAI curve at Tm. This is equivalent to choosing the stock and harvesting effort
that will maximize the sustained yield in fisheries (MSY). Under this approach
each year 1/Tm of the forest would be harvested (assuming all stands are identical). This is otherwise known as the fully managed forest and in the past has been
the basis for calculations used in determining sustainable harvest levels on public
lands in North America and Europe.

Economic models
Much as in the case in fisheries, a maximization of total production has been the
focus of public resource managers. This approach based on biological criteria has
been criticized because it does not take economic criteria into account, and we
now turn to economic models of timber management that have been focused on
identifying the optimal age to harvest trees. The problem is phrased as choosing
the optimal rotation age for a forest stand, given a set of exogenous variables

The single stand, one rotation problem
In the most basic formulation of the problem, it is assumed that the stand has been
established and that there are no costs involved in tending the stand, and that a
new stand will not be established after harvest. Expressing the value of the tree at
time t as the constant price net of harvesting, P, times the volume V(t), the net
present value of a harvest at time T is then:
  ( (P)(V(T) )eT

The one period optimal rotation problem can then be written as choosing the optimal harvest age, Ts, that maximizes the net present value:

the trees while the right-hand side is the return if all the trees were harvested
and the money put in a bank to receive a rate of interest equal to the discount rate.
When the net price (P) is constant, this is equivalent to choosing the rotation length
where the growth rate (expressed in percentage terms) is equal to the discount rate.
The example in box 5.1 shows how the economically optimum time to harvest is
chosen when actual data on growth rates and timber values are used to weigh the
benefits of postponing the harvest one more year against the forgone income.

BOX 5.1

CHOOSING WHEN TO HARVEST

The growth function in figure 5.1 was drawn from actual data for Douglas fir trees
growing in the Pacific northwest in the US (Clawson, 1977). The fitted curve is V  40t 
3.1t 2 0.016t 3 where volume is expressed in cubic feet per acre. The table below shows
the standing volume, mean annual increment, and current annual increment at 10 year
intervals and selected years. The reported values in the two right-hand columns are
based on an estimated stumpage rate of $10 per cubic metre starting at age 30 and rising
by $2 every 10 years until age 80 and then remaining constant at $20 per cubic metre. The
values are then converted into cubic feet per acre. They show the mean annual increment
reaches its maximum between ages 90 and 100; however, discounting the value shortens
the optimal harvest age in the case of a 3 percent discount rate to age 70, and in the case
of a 9 percent discount rate to age 30 – the moment it becomes profitable to harvest. This
illustrates the power of discounting, where the longer timespan associated with timber
production typically reduces future values significantly, a problem explored later in the
discussion on public land management.
